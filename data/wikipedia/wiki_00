Kura, who worked on the songs \"Don't Stop\" and \"It's Show Time!!!.\"\nAi worked with Japanese composer The Company on three songs, \"Butterfly,\" \"The Answer\" and the single \"Taisetsu na Mono.\"\nThe team who worked together on the drama single \"One,\" arranger and composer Toshiaki Matsumoto, were the same pair who created R&B singer Misia's 2000 hit ballad \"Everything.\"\nOne other Japanese producer worked on the album, , who produced the original version of \"Get Up.\"\nFor the first time, Ai worked with European songwriters.\nDanish producer Jonas Jeberg wrote and produced both songs on the album's first single, \"I'll Remember You/Brand New Day,\" while Swedish producers Fredrik \"Fredro\" \u00d6desj\u00f6 and Mats Berntoft produced \"Feel So Good.\"\nAi also collaborated with three American R&B/hip-hop producers: Ty Fyffe on \"Ima,\" Troy Taylor on \"My Sweet Home\" and Darryl \"Da Rulah\" Farmer on \"Move.\"\nThe album was primarily recorded at Prime Sound Studio Form and TamStar Studio Tokyo, with additional recording at Real & Beats Studio, Peninsula Studio, Crescente Studio and Tomita Lab Studio, all in Tokyo.\nSeveral songs' instrumentals were recorded overseas, at Jayjay Productions Studio, New York City and Murlyn Studios, Stockholm.\nUnlike her previous studio album, \"What's Goin' On Ai\" (2006), where Ai had collaborated with four overseas musicians, she now collaborated with five Japanese musicians.\nOn the song \"Butterfly,\" Ai worked with three other female vocalists, rapper , rock musician Anna Tsuchiya and reggae artist Pushim.\nThis was the first time Ai worked with any of these musicians.\nAi was friends with all three musicians, having first met Anty the Kunoichi when she performed at a club in Nagoya, and having first met Tsuchiya on the set of the 2006 film \"Memories of Matsuko\", where both artists had made cameo appearances.\nAi was later featured on Tsuchiya's single \"Crazy World\" the next year.\nOn the song \"Get Up,\" Ai collaborated with half-brother hip-hop MCs and Zeebra.\nAi had collaborated with Sphere of Influence in 2002 on his single \"Luv Ya,\" and with Zeebra twice before (\"Golden Mic (Remix)\" in 2003 and \"Do What U Gotta Do\" in 2006).\n\"Don't Stop\" samples the melody of the song \"Hush\" written by Joe South, originally performed by Billy Joe Royal, made famous by Deep Purple in the 1960s.\n\"Brand New Day\" is a track based on the same music as American \"High School Musical\" singer Corbin Bleu's song \"Marchin'\" from his debut album \"Another Side\".\nThe song was released on Bleu's album one month before Ai's full length digital release of \"Brand New Day,\" but one month after the ringtone release of Ai's version.\nThe song \"The Answer\" was originally made for \"Team Medical Dragon\"'s season two theme song, however the drama producers were looking for a \"peaceful\" song for the theme song instead.\n\"One\" was created by Ai after hearing the creators' decision.\nIn \"I Remember You,\" Ai tried to write lyrics to remember the people who encouragedd her to become a singer.\nShe did not write the song with love in mind.\nThe four singles released from the album all received major tie-ups.\n\"Brand New Day\" was the Japan Airlines \"JAL+One World\" television commercial song, and \"I'll Remember You\" was used in headphone company Audio-Technica's 2007 campaign.\nThe song was also featured in commercials for digital download provider \"music.jp\" commercials.\n\"One\" was the theme song to the second season of \"Team Medical Dragon\", for which Ai's \"Believe\" (2006) served as the theme song in the initial series.\n\"Taisetsu na Mono\" was used in a 2008 campaign for Chartis Insurance, which cheered on athletes at the 2008 Beijing Summer Olympics.\nIt also was used as the theme song for the American drama series \"Heroes\" in Japan.\nAi debuted her single \"I'll Remember You\" live at the 2007 MTV Video Music Awards Japan on May 26, 2007.\nAi also performed at the Live Earth charity concert on July 7, 2007, performing seven songs including \"I'll Remember You\" and \"Brand New Day.\"\nShe performed a free concert outside of the Tokyo Metropolitan Government Building on December 22, 2007, as a part of the Beijing Olympics promotion campaign.\nBeginning February 2008, Ai toured the album extensively across Japan, performing 32 concerts at 28 venues on her \"Don't Stop Ai Japan Tour 2008\".\nThe tour ended on May 27 and May 28, with two performances at the Nippon Budokan.\nThe final concert was released to DVD on November 26, 2008.\nAi appeared on music TV shows Music Station on June 6, 2008, and Bokura no Ongaku on June 13, 2008, performing \"Taisetsu na Mono.\"\n\"Listen Japan\"'s Morio Mori called the album splended and impressive, and felt it was a signature album of Ai's.\nHe was impressed by the colalboration track \"Butterfly,\" calling it a \"current day \"Lady Marmalade.\"\"\n\"What's In?\"\nreviewers called \"Brand New Day\" an \"awesome uptempo number\" that brought images of marching, with the song's \"tight beats and Ai's powerful vocals.\"\nThey praised the single \"Taisetsu na Mono,\" calling the vocals \"warm\" and the chorus work \"profound.\"\nTetsuo Hiraga of \"Hot Express\" felt that the lyrics of \"One\" were \"deep, kind and straight forward.\"\nCDJournal reviewers described \"Brand New Day\" as having \"funky and fat beats.\"\nAi won one award for the videos from the album, and was nominated twice.\nShe won the Best Buzz Asia - Japan award at the 2008 MTV Video Music Awards Japan for \"I'll Remember You,\" which was also nominated for the best R&B video award.\n\"Brand New Day\" was nominated for Best Female Video at the 2008 Space Shower Music Video Awards.\nThe album debuted at number four in Japan with 45,000 copies sold, underneath B'z, Kazumasa Oda and Yui Aragaki.\nIt was not as much of a long seller album as Ai's previous works, spending only two weeks in the top 20, and 12 weeks in the top 300.\nThe album was certified gold by the RIAJ for 100,000 physical copies shipped to stores in its month of release.\nAs of 2012, this album is Ai's fifth most successful release, and fourth most successful original album.\nPersonnel details were sourced from \"Don't Stop Ai\"s liner notes

Martin's ragtime farce-comedy, \"The Late Mr.\nEarly\".\nThe following year she appeared with the Dunne and Ryley Company as the orphan 'Pony Luce' in Charles Hale Hoyt's \"A Milk White Flag\".\nIn the late summer of 1900 Hite was a soloist with Boston's \"The Howard's Own Show Company\" before embarking on a two-season tour as 'Estelle Coocoo' in the Morton-Kerker musical comedy \"The Telephone Girl\".\nIn 1902 she played the 'waif' in road productions of the Charles Dazey melodrama \"The Burglar and the Waif\" and the following year toured in the musical \"The Chaperons\", as Phrosia.\nHite made her Broadway debut at the Knickerbocker Theatre on May 2, 1904, as 'Nerissa' in the musical comedy \"A Venetian Romance\", and the following year at Chicago's Garrick Theatre she played 'Captain Prissy Ping' in L. Frank Baum's \"The Woggle-Bug\".\nIn 1905 it was rumored that she was to marry the athlete Arthur Duffey, and as she was a divorcee he would meet Pope Pius X in order to attain special dispensation to wed.\nThe rumor proved false.\nLater that year she toured with the Frank L. Perley Opera Company opposite Viola Gillette in \"The Girl and the Bandit\".\nFor the following season Hite joined forces with vaudevillian Walter Jones to form an act that met with success at vaudeville venues in and around New York City.\nOn March 30, 1907, Hite starred as 'Tillie Day' in B. C. Whitney's production of \"A Knight for a Day\" at Chicago's Whitney Opera House and the next spring she came back to Broadway to play 'Martha Scraggs' at the Circle Theatre (Broadway at 60th St.) in \"The Merry-Go-Round\".\nHite returned to vaudeville with her husband, professional baseball player Mike Donlin, in a series of comedic baseball skits.\nShe last appeared in vaudeville in the spring of 1912 in a skit entitled \"Mabel Hite and Her Clowns\".\nHer last Broadway appearance came the year before at Wallack's Theatre playing 'Norah' in the musical farce \"A Certain Party\".\nHite died after a long struggle with intestinal cancer on October 22, 1912, at her mother's residence in New York City.\nShe was survived by Donlin, her husband for six years.\nHite had married once before, to Edward Ellis Hamlin, the son of a wealthy Marshall Field's executive, after a whirlwind courtship in 1901.\nTheir union ended in 1905 after two years of divorce proceedings."}

Balch and engineer Floyd E. Stanbery, the Visalia Fox Theatre was erected at the end of the Silent Film era at a cost of $225,000 (2.9 million in 2010 dollars).\nIt is one of many such theaters throughout the United States and Canada built by William Fox and his Fox Film Corporation, later to become 20th Century Fox.\nThe Fox Theatre opened on February 27, 1930.\nOpening night featured a talkie western, a newsreel, a Mickey Mouse\ncartoon and a Laurel and Hardy comedy.\nThe theatre and the streets around it were packed for the premiere\u2014quite a feat in a town of 7,000\u2014an indication of the central role it would play in the community for decades to come.\nThe Fox would remain a one-screen auditorium theater for over 45 years until 1976, when most movie theaters were becoming multiplexes.\nHaving been purchased by the expanding Mann Theater corporation, and in order to stay in competition with two triplex movie theatres opening in Visalia around the same time, the one-auditorium was split into three screens.\nThe ground level of the theatre was divided into two auditoriums, with two different screens, while the balcony of the theater became the third auditorium.\nThe Fox would continue with this format showing first-run movies for 20 years until late 1996, when Mann built a 12-screen multiplex in the Sequoia Mall on the other side of town.\nWith the opening of the new multiplex, Mann shut down the doors to the Fox after 66 years of showing movies.\nIt wasn't very long before the Fox would be restored to its same mint condition as the day it opened in 1930.\nThe Fox is an atmospheric theatre designed to evoke the feeling of being outside in a far-away place.\nThis style of movie theater was common during the roaring twenties and into the Great Depression, when they were particularly popular as a fantastical escape from harsh realities outside.\nAtmospheric theatres were created to be unique experiences.\nEach was made with a different theme in mind, and the interior of the Visalia Fox emulates a temple garden in India or South Asia.\nThe ceiling is dotted with stars which flicker and glow during movies and performances to give the appearance of a clear night sky.\nThere are elaborate \"temples\" or \"pagodas\" flanked by murals on either side of the stage, and a hand-sculpted genie\u2014a fearsome face between two elephants\u2014above the proscenium arch.\nThe decadently lavish ambiance of the theater is the result of an artistic technique called trompe-l'\u0153il, a French phrase indicating an object that appears to be something it is not.\nCommon at the beginning of the culture industry and the Golden Age of Hollywood, this kitsch approach to construction was a simple function of finances and practicability.\nAs the studios stepped up competition for the attention and admiration of their audiences, hundreds upon thousands of elaborate environments were erected across the world.\nArchitects and contractors eschewed prohibitively expensive materials like high-quality wood, gold leaf, and marble for more reasonably-priced ingredients like plaster and paint.\nThe Fox was shuttered in November 1996 and remained closed until a group of nostalgic community members known as \"Friends of the Fox\" took up the task of acquiring and restoring the decaying theatre.\nThe clock tower, long neglected, was filled with years of pigeon filth; the giant six-foot clock\u2014a nuisance to keep on-time even in its heyday\u2014was meticulously reassembled by a local engineer and the clock's former keeper.\nMuch of the intricate interior of the building was destroyed in 1976 by the hasty conversion to a three screen multiplex.\nThe genie above the stage was delicately and painstakingly re-sculpted by a local volunteer using old pictures as a template.\nMost of the murals needed repainting, and countless flourishes and decorations needed replacing.\nAfter three years and an outpouring of support from Visalia and surrounding communities, the restoration was complete.\nMarvin Hamlisch played the Grand Re-Opening to a sold-out house on November 20, 1999.\nThe theater remains a vibrant performing arts center and defining feature of the community.\nNearly all of the Tulare County Symphony performances are held at the Fox.\nFilms are also still shown at the theater on occasion notably classic films, many of which were shown at the theatre many years prior when they were in first run."}

Money, Kriss Darling, Muzikal Sheriff, DJ Rytrap, Mc Daddy Konya (RIP) and MC Fullstop.\nIn the late 1980s, reggae and the associated Jamaican culture became so popular in Kenya that the government owned Kenya Broadcasting Corporation KBC radio station launched the program \"Reggae Times\" for reggae fans who tuned to the English service.\nThe show was presented by veteran reggae DJ Jeff Mwangemi.\nIn August 2005 \"Metro FM\", a subsidiary of the government owned Kenya Broadcasting Corporation (KBC), became an exclusive 24-hour reggae station whose slogan was \"House of Reggae\".\nOn January 30, 2009 Metro FM hosted First Ever Radio Clash In Kenya and also in Africa.\nWhich was hosted By Dj Stano and Njambi Koikai ,2 Sounds system were \"Rebel Liberation Sounds\" (Githurai 45) and \"Existenz Sounds\" (Farover).\nIn 2011, \"Metro FM\" switched away from reggae and became \"Venus FM\", a station targeted at office-class ladies in Kenya's urban areas.\nMany Kenyan reggae fans were disappointed.\nThe gap left by \"Metro FM\" was soon taken filled by \"Ghetto FM\", a \"Sheng\" (Kenyan slang) speaking station that claims to be the voice of the youth in the Kenyan ghettos.\nAs at 2014, the selectors on \"Ghetto FM\" reggae sessions were DJ Bonokode and DJ Ambuside.\nDrop Zone Assembly, airing on Hot 96 has also been receiving positive response from the masses.\nDrop Zone is hosted by Rapcha the sayantist.\nUp to the late 1990s, reggae in Kenya was known as the \"poor man's\" music.\nIn the 2000s, the popularity of reggae caught the attention of the emerging FM radio stations.\nTo avoid the perceived dark and underclass side of reggae and to attract listeners who could generate advertising revenue, the new FM radio stations concentrated on the emerging Dancehall brand of reggae.\nDancehall reggae has softer and simpler beats than roots or ragga and it rarely projects the Rastafarian culture, anti-colonialism or the agenda of African emancipation.\nDancehall mostly focuses on love songs in an urban setting.\nSome Kenyan fans of Roots reggae express disappointment with the emergence of Dancehall reggae.\nThe complaints revolve around the lack of a communal African agenda within Dancehall reggae and the watering down of reggae into mere expressions of bodily desire and materialism.\nReggae videos began making their way onto Kenyan television in the early 1990s through KBC's \"Music Time\" show that was hosted by Fred Obachi Machoka.\nIn those days, the popular reggae/ragga artists featured were Shaba Ranks, Yellow Man, Ras Kimono and UB40.\nAround 1992, KTN launched the program \"Rastrut\", a thirty-minute show dedicated to reggae music.\nAs at 2014, KTN is the only Kenyan television station that has ever had a show dedicated to reggae.\nIt is also the only Kenyan media station that specifically associated reggae music with the religious and cultural ideals of the Rastafarian movement.\nThis is in the choice of the name \"Rastrut\" and the use of the characteristic Green-Yellow-Red as the background colours of the show.\n\"Rastrut\" is the show that made Lucky Dube visible to Kenyans.\nAfter Digital migration in 2013, There has been many upcoming Tv stations that have given Reggae Music more airtime.\nNotably, Kenyatta University's Television (KUTV) came up witha strictly Roots Reggae music named Reggae Iration.\nThe show has various segments: Inner Mi yard, Wisdom knowledge and overstanding, Artiste of the day, Live interviews and Word sound and power alongside updates on what is happening in the reggae scene.\nreggae Iration is a show for everyone, the show to watch\nJamaican artists often perform in live shows hosted in Nairobi and Mombasa.\nNeo Reggae Events by WeN_Music is an ongoing series of reggae events in the country\nChristian Reggae group \"Christafari\" visited Kenya in the late 1990s and will be performing in Nairobi on 25 January 2015.\nInternational Reggae Day (Kenya Chapter) in July, 01, 2018 held at the August Memorial Park, Nairobi by Wadada Pamoja under license from International Reggae Day, Jamaica.\nIt should be noted that in Kenya, the words DJ and MC are ambiguous and refer to traditional DJs who popularise music, music re-sellers and events organisers.\nMany Kenyan DJs double up as artistes, music producers, band-members and events organisers.\nReggae DeeJaying in Kenya is of two kinds;\nReggae MCs are announcers who make motivating statements during reggae events.\nThe themes of songs composed by Kenyan reggae artists can be categorized as\nAlthough Kenyan Christians resent the drug, alcohol, wild party and dreadlock lifestyles associated with Kenyan reggae fans and Kenyan Rastafarians, a notable number of Kenyan gospel musicians favour the reggae style of instrumental arrangement.\nThis is probably because they secretly like the style music or they recognize its popularity among Kenyans.\nReggae styling of Kenyan gospel songs\nKenyan gospel music producers often overlay conventional Kiswahili singing on reggae styled tracks and this partly obscures the reggae nature of the drum beats, guitar chops and bass-guitars in the songs.\nConsequently, only a few keen Kenyan listeners would identify such songs as reggae especially when the singers are not Rastafarians or lack Jamaican slang and accent.\nExamples of such Kenyan gospel songs are Damu Ya Yesu and Yesu Wangu na Mpenda by Mary Atieno Ominde, Mbingu Zahubiri by Paul Kigame and Waraka wa Hamani by Bahati Bukuku.\nBetween 1997 and 2002, the US based Christian Reggae group Christafari enjoyed notable popularity in Kenya through KTN, Family FM (now Radio 316) and Tune in Music Stores.\nDuring one of their visits to Kenya, they witnessed the tragic state of the Kibera slums in the capital city of Nairobi and composed the song Nairobi.\nLucky Dube is the most emulated reggae artiste in Kenya.\nHis popularity is so high that some Kenyan gospel artists brazenly flout copyright laws and reproduce his tracks with their own gospel lyrics.\nA glaring example is a Kikuyu gospel song titled \"Tiga nii We\" which is an exact reproduction of \"Back to my Roots\" by Lucky Dube, the only difference been the substitution of the original English lyrics with gospel content in the Kikuyu language.\nDespite the obvious theft of Lucky Dube's tracks and the blatant violation of the Biblical commandments against theft and conformity to secularism, such songs receive airplay especially on the ethnic radio stations and are promoted as Christian songs.\nIronically, the same stations also play Lucky Dube's music while claiming to be promoting Kenyan originality.\nArtists such as Ecspedition Donteh have inspiration from people deviating on the original kenyan or african culture when everyone was for each one and not a system where everyone did their own way ,and others have great ifluences from people like lucky dube and african slave children like bob marley and luciano respectively.\nA great interest in the music was inspired from the early days while reggae was still regarded as gangstars or rebellion music by the then administration.\nReggae music is so loved in Kenya that it is common to hear Kenyan youth speaking Jamaican Patois on the streets of Nairobi especially in the slum areas.\nThere are Kenyan Rastafarians who learnt English by listening to reggae music and reggae fans.\nExamples of words added to the Sheng vocabulary are-\nThe usage of the words \"massive\" and \"man like\" were creations of DJ.\nJeff Mwangemi of KBC, presenter of \"Reggae Times\"\nThe state of reggae music in Kenya cannot be divorced from the Kenyan versions of the Rastafarian culture and the matatu sub-culture of Nairobi.\nIt has to be judged within the context of how the Kenyan population perceives the local Rastafarian movement and the messages in the reggae music of the 1990s.\nEven more significant is the position of the Rastafarian movement within the social-economic divide between the middle class and the poor lower class population of the Kenyan urban areas.\nMost of the genre's pioneers like Bob Marley, Peter Tosh and Bunny Wailer were all Rastafarians.\nThe Kenyan Rasta movement is mostly made up of men who are marginalized from the regular education system and are poor slum dwellers living at the edges of the urban areas.\nMany Kenyan craftsmen, matatu conductors, music instrumentalists, acrobats, traditional dancers and casual labourers express some form of Rastafarian expression as an alternative religion whose language and ideologies they can identify with.\nFor them, the Rastafarian movement is a social or religious grouping that does not have the formalism and officialdom of foreign western Christianity.\nRasta culture offer them a flexible language and a cultural worldview that accommodates people of their economic class.\nIt offers them a sense of social dignity derived from the mythical story of historic oppression.\nThe spotting of dreadlocks by Kenyan women and men is not always an indicator of their inclinations to the Rastafarian movement or their love for reggae music.\nMany Kenyan Rastafarians spot a scarf, headband, bangle or shirt that has the black, green, yellow and red colours which are known as Rasta colours in Kenya.\nMany Kenyan craftsmen tend to associate themselves with the Rastafarian movement and consequently, almost half of the items sold in Kenyan curio shops have the green, yellow, red and black colours that characterize the Rastafarian movement.\nThe use of the cannabis leaf symbol in Kenyan ghetto art works, dress items and matatu stickers has increased and this has only exacerbated negative publicity associated with reggae music in Kenya.\nIt should be noted, however that in some parts of Kenya and among some social groups, especially those in the coast province, rasta-colours are often associated with social groups that have nothing to do with either reggae or Rastafarians and may have a connection with drug dealing and petty theft.\nKenyan Rastafarians display a noticeable ideological understanding of the lyrics in reggae songs and non-musical teachings of reggae musicians and writers.\nFor example, whenever Kenyans confront a news item touching on racism, some Kenyan Rastas may be heard quoting Lucky Dube's song Different Colours One People as a moral proverb towards racial tolerance.\nIn Kenya, there is a stereotypical perception that reggae is the poor man's music.\nThis is probably due to the recurrent themes of poverty and emancipation in Jamaican Roots reggae and its popularity among disenfranchised Kenyan youth.\nThe association of reggae with the lower class and economically sidelined population is suspected to be the reason why in 2011, the financially struggling 6 year old \"Metro FM\" changed from a purely reggae station to \"Venus FM\" with a programming scheme that could attract advertisements targeting typical urban office-class ladies.\nThe gap left by Metro FM was soon taken filled by Ghetto FM, a Sheng (Kenyan slang) speaking station that claims to be the voice of the youth in the Kenyan ghettos.\nDue to the same factors that make reggae the style of choice by the underclass, reggae seems to be the style of choice by Kenyan persons who have disabilities or wish to create concern among able bodied persons.\nProfessor Naaman, Mighty King Kong and Baba Gurston Opar of the Leonard Cheshire Disability Young Voices chose reggae as their medium.\nGospel musicians Reuben Kigame and Mary Atieno also chose some of their songs to be in reggae style.\nDaddy Owen's song, Mbona explores the marginalization of persons living with disabilities and is done in a mild reggae style.\nIn the early 1990s, during the explosion of personal and portable music systems, it became fashionable for matatus (privately owned public service vehicles) to blast loud music despite protests by passengers and the illegality of the practice.\nMatatu serving different parts of Nairobi, the capital city, became associated with different styles of music.\nFor example, those serving the eastern side were famous for ragga while those serving Kangemi were known for pop, RnB and the developing hip hop styles.\nThe matatus plying Kikuyu, Dagoretti, and Ngong areas focused on reggae and even today, they preferentially play Roots and Dancehall reggae.\nThe liking for reggae spread to Kabete and Thika Matatus.\nIt is worth noting that these matatu routes serve areas dominated by the Kikuyu ethnic group and its historic desire for emancipation from colonialism and oppression by the KANU government.\nDagoretti is on the outskirts of Nairobi and has the social environment in which reggae music can flourish- a contradicting mix of poverty, wealth and rich ethnic history.\nThe reggae bands \"Chaka Lion\" and \"Survivors\" are based in Dagoretti.\nSome researchers (Horace Campbell) associate the origin of the dreadlocks of the Rastafarian movement with those of the Kikuyu freedom fighters who were branded Mau Mau by the colonial authorities.\nJamaican Rastafarian symbols such as the name Ras Tafari, the Lion of Judah and the green, yellow and red flag are derived from Ethiopia, which borders Kenya to the north.\nThe Nyabinghi section of the Rastafarian movement derives its name from the Uganda and Rwandese regions west of Kenya.\nJamaican reggae groups and artists such as Black Uhuru and Ras Kenyatta derived their names from the Mau Mau related news that was flowing from Kenya in the 1950s.\nRita Marley's song, Harambee is derived from the slogan call introduced by the former and first President of Kenya, Jomo Kenyatta, who was a Kikuyu.\nIn the late 1990s and early 2000s, at the climax of the anti-KANU efforts that were mostly led by Kikuyu politicians, the Kikuyu youth groupings known as Mungiki became indistinguishable from the Kenyan Rastafarians.\nBoth groups spotted dreadlocks, reproductions of the Ethiopian green, yellow and red flag and both were known for heavy smoking of cigarettes, raw tobacco and marijuana.\nDue to their low-class and peri-urban status, many Kikuyu matatu drivers, conductors and operators who were reggae lovers inadvertently became members of the Mungiki movement.\nEven today, the average Kenyan associates the Rastafarian green, yellow and red regalia with Mungiki although the Mungiki sect officially identifies itself with the colours green, white, red and black.\nThe reggae sub-culture in Kenya is strongly associated with beer partying, rowdy and theft-prone gigs, heavy cigarette smoking, \"khat\" chewing (locally known as \"miraa\") and the use of cannabis (locally known as \"bhangi\", \"weed\", \"herb\", \"marijuana\", \"hazard\", \"bomb\", \"boza\" or \"stone\"\nIn Kenya, Reggae events are the most chaotic and theft laden gigs.\nSome local TV comedians make fun of this by stereotypically presenting all reggae fans as thieves who have no interest in reggae music.\nDue to the wide underclass following, many reggae fans see the reggae events as opportunities to steal from well-off fans.\nSome notable cases are as listed below\nMismanagement of artistes\nIn June 2013, Alpha Blondy and Tarrus Riley jetted into Kenya but failed to show up at the KICC grounds where their fans rioted at 3 A.M. on realizing that the expected artistes would not perform.\nDue to the value attached towards cannabis by some reggae musicians and sections of the Rastafarian movement, reggae music is seen by some Kenyan youth as an expression of the licence to engage in unrestrained indulgence.\nLucky Dube's concert in December 1998 at the Ngong Race Course grounds was so packed with revelers and numerous reported offenses that for the first time, Kenya Police transported drunkards and suspected petty thieves in police helicopters.\nAccording to Hillary Koech, a Kenyan media blogger and freelance journalist, underclass Kenyan reggae fans often carry ghetto- neighbourhood hostilities to reggae gigs and sometimes engage in murders over petty conflicts.\nThe Kenyan brand of the Rastafarian movement is plagued by associations with social actions that are contrary to those regular rasta movements and the messages in reggae music.\nBenard Matheri, a Most Wanted gangster who was shot dead by police in 1997 and was known as Rasta because of his dreadlocks.\nThe mingling of Kenyan Rastafarians with the murderous acts of the Mungiki sect only tarnished the reputation of the rasta movement and reggae music further.\nIn parts of the Coast province of Kenya, the rasta colours green, yellow and red are a gangster identity that has nothing to do with either reggae or Rastafarians and is often associated with violent theft, drug dealing and homosexual unions that may involve European tourists.\nFor many years, Kenyan reggae gigs were promoted through posters that featured pictures of the artists or graphics suggestive of struggles against colonialism.\nBetween 2003 and 2006 when Dancehall reggae was making its way into Kenya, some reggae DJs began publicizing their gigs by using sexually suggestive posters of partly and fully naked Jamaican women.\nSome Kenyan reggae fans have also been complaining that local Dancehall gigs are mostly oriented towards sexual expression rather than the deeper religious and cultural orientation of Roots reggae.\nReggae music is the most copied and plagiarized genre of music in Kenya.\nAs at 2014, it is practically impossible to gain legitimate access to original CDs of reggae music originating from outside Kenya.\nIt is also quite difficult to get full versions of reggae songs that do not have interjections, interruptions and self-promoting announcements by mixing DJs.\nUnlike the 1990s, Kenyan DJs no longer mention the titles of the songs they play nor do they state the names of the singers or give a background history of the songs.\nSome DJs create mix-tapes or remixes of songs and then announces their own names over the remixes and unintentionally creating the impression that the songs are their own works."}

broodmare, who was undefeated in a career of eight races.\nTiffin won five races in 1928 including the National Breeders' Produce Stakes at Sandown Park and the Cheveley Park Stakes at Newmarket and was the highest-rated British two-year-old of either sex.\nHer three-year-old season was disrupted by illness and injury, but she won all three of her starts, proving herself the year's best sprinter with wins in the July Cup at Newmarket and the King George Stakes at Goodwood.\nAt her peak she was regarded as one of the fastest racehorses in the world.\nAt the end of her racing career she was retired to stud where she produced one foal before dying in 1931.\nTiffin was a small bay filly bred by Sir John Rutherford, 1st Baronet, a Conservative Party politician who previously owned the St Leger Stakes and Ascot Gold Cup winner Solario.\nShe was sired by Tetratema, the leading British two-year-old of 1919 who went on to win the 2000 Guineas and many important sprint races.\nAs a stallion, Tetratema sired many good sprinters and milers and was the British champion sire in Tiffin's three-year-old season.\nHer dam, Dawn Wind (or Dawn-Wind) was reportedly regarded by her trainer George Lambton as the fastest filly he ever trained, but never ran in a race owing to injury.\nAs a foal, Tiffin suffered badly from an infestation of worms and failed to thrive.\nRutherford sold her for 1,100 guineas to Lord Ellesmere who sent the filly into training with Fred Darling.\nDarling, who trained at Beckhampton in Wiltshire had recently won the first of his six British trainers championships.\nDespite her small stature and persistent health problems, Tiffin was a high-spirited and \"playful\" filly, who was often difficult to handle.\nTiffin began her racing career with a win in the Wilbraham Stakes at Newmarket in spring.\nShe was then sent to Sandown to contest the five furlong National Breeders' Produce Stakes, which at the time was the most valuable race of the season for two-year-olds, with prize money of over \u00a37,000.\nShe won from the colt Mr Jinks, who went on to win the following year's 2000 Guineas.\nIn doing so she emulated her sire Tetratema and her grandsire The Tetrarch, who had won the race in 1919 and 1913 respectively.\nTiffin maintained her run of success by winning the Ham Stakes at Goodwood in July and the Convivial Plate at York Racecourse in August.\nHer victory in the latter race was particularly well-received, as it gave her popular jockey Gordon Richards his hundredth win of the season.\nOn her final run of the season she appeared at Newmarket in October for the six furlong Cheveley Park Stakes, the most prestigious race of the year for two-year-old fillies in Britain.\nShe won easily to confirm her status as the one of the best British juveniles of 1928.\nThroughout the season, Tiffin had shown a calm, intelligent attitude on the racecourse and exceptional early speed which often had her opponents struggling from the start.\nShe was entered in the following year's 1000 Guineas and Epsom Oaks, but some observers doubted that she would have the stamina to become a classic winner.\nIn the official Free Handicap, a ranking of the best two-year-olds, she was assigned top weight of 133 pounds, one pound ahead of the top-rated colts Mr Jinks and Costaki Pasha.\nIn early 1929, Tiffin was reported to be working well at Beckhampton and was expected to run in a public trial race before taking her chance in the 1000 Guineas.\nThe filly then fell gravely ill with an \"internal ailment\" which placed her life in danger and forced her to miss all her spring engagements including the Guineas and the Oaks.\nShe made her first appearance as a three-year-old at Royal Ascot in June when she ran in the five furlong Fern Hill Stakes.\nTiffin won \"in a canter\" from some of the best British sprinters with Le Phare, a colt who went on to win the Sussex Stakes and the Stewards' Cup, taking second place.\nTiffin was then sent to Newmarket for the six furlong July Cup.\nThe closing stages of the race developed into a contest between Tiffin and the four-year-old colt Royal Minstrel (also sired by Tetratema), the winner of the St. James's Palace Stakes and the Cork and Orrery Stakes.\nAfter appearing beaten inside the final furlong, Tiffin rallied to gain the lead in the closing strides and won by a short head in a new track record time of 1:12.2.\nThe filly's win was received with \"marked enthusiasm\" by the Newmarket crowd.\nIn his next race, Royal Minstrel recorded an upset win over Fairway in the Eclipse Stakes.\nLater in the same month, Tiffin reverted to five furlongs for the King George Stakes at Goodwood and won impressively from the filly Pladda.\nWhile being exercised at Beckhampton in autumn 1929, Tiffin broke loose from her handlers and slipped on a road.\nShe sustained a broken bone in her knee which forced her retirement from racing.\nAt the time of her retirement she was ranked alongside Royal Minstrel and Fairway as one of the three best horses in England and was described in the press as \"the fastest horse in the world, irrespective of age or sex\".\nIn their book, \"A Century of Champions\", based on the Timeform rating system, John Randall and Tony Morris rated Tiffin the seventeenth best two-year-old filly trained in Britain or Ireland in the 20th century.\nTiffin retired to stud where she produced a filly foal sired by Blandford on 17 February 1931.\nA few days after giving birth, Tiffin became seriously ill and was found to be suffering from peritonitis and a perforated bowel.\nShe died on 7 March at the Stetchworth stud in Newmarket.\nHer daughter, named Merenda, was raised by a foster mare and went on to win three races including the Chesham Stakes at Royal Ascot in 1933.\nMerenda was the direct female ancestor of many winners, most notably the Breeders' Cup Sprint winner Smile."}

{"id": "36953613", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36953613", "title": "Reclaiming Patriotism", "text": "Reclaiming Patriotism\nReclaiming Patriotism: Nation-Building for Australian Progressives is a 2009 book by Tim Soutphommasane published by Cambridge University Press.\nIt's the lead title of the Australian Encounters series which argues that the Australian left have misunderstood patriotism and should embrace it in order to re-engage with political discourse and ordinary Australians.\nIn the introduction to his book, Soutphommasane argues that patriotism is important and relevant to the modern era for three reasons.\nThe first is the challenge of solidarity, which refers to the need for Australian people to have a common unifying identity in an era of multiculturalism and diversity.\nSecondly, Soutphommasane says that progressives must avoid intellectual complacency about national discourses and instead engage in such conversations in order to explain how Australia is today and to challenge the Australian right's dominance in this area.\nThirdly is the importance for the left of articulating a positive cultural vision of their own in order to become more influential and persuasive advocates of their cause.\nThe first chapter deals with how progressives in Australia have come to interpret all appeals to nationalism and Australianness as merely being \u2018dog whistles\u2019 to racist Australians who pick up the prejudiced undertones of such messages.\nAccording to Soutphommasane, Australian leftists are wrong to think this way because the majority of Australians love Australia, and patriotism need not be racist or based on exclusion.\nSoutphommasane also says that such effortless dismissals of patriotic sentiments hinder the left's ability to understand and connect with the broader Australian population.\nChapter 2 explores whether left liberal values of universalism and compassion for all human beings are compatible with patriotism, which feels a higher level of connection with people of the same country.\nSoutphommasane argues that the left side of politics in Australia used to be patriotic, but that this declined in the 1960s and has given way to a suspicion of nationalistic feelings.\nThe author concludes that there no necessary contradiction.\nSoutphommasane writes that \"A distinctive brand of egalitarianism, a robust democracy supported by an Anzac myth \u2013 these are the foundations of an Australian patriotism\".\nHe also argues that progressive criticisms of Australia and its history are compatible with patriotism as a more sophisticated love of one's country involves acknowledging its faults as well as celebrating its virtues.\nThis chapter firstly deals with how the Anzac tradition can be shared by new Australians, whose ancestors were neither Anzacs not Australians.\nAccording to Soutphommasane (who is himself of Chinese and Laotian extraction), \"while I am unable to claim direct lineage back to Anzac, the whole legend can still resonate for me because I can relate to the mateship and the egalitarianism\".\nIssues concerning the White Australia Policy and multiculturalism are then explored.\nSoutphommasane advocates a \u2018liberal middle ground on diversity\u2019 which values expressions of cultural identity insofar as they contribute to individual autonomy or social cohesion.\nThe rest of the chapter questions whether dual citizenship should be permissible, given that it would make some citizens out of convenience, rather than love of country.\nThis chapter deals with the concept of nation building, which Soutphommasane laments has become synonymous with infrastructure in political discourse.\nNevertheless, Soutphommasane praises Kevin Rudd's use of the term and outlines how progressive politics involves a more activist government which builds bridges, roads, rails, high speed broadband and other public works.\nBut to Soutphommasane, the concept of nation building extends beyond just infrastructure and also involves civics and solidarity within a nation.\nAn applied patriotism is also required.\nThis chapter deals with the debate of whether or not Australia should move from a monarchy to a republic.\nAccording to Soutphommasane, it is regrettable that both sides of the debate view the issue as being purely symbolic.\nSoutphommasane writes that:\n\"A republic denotes a political community rooted in the popular will of citizens and conducted for the common good; it denotes a society in which people govern themselves, through elected representatives, and on the basis that every member of society is of equal standing.\nA monarchy, in its most literal sense, means 'the rule of one'.\nThose who belong to a community governed by a monarch are not citizens, but are subjects of a monarch who attains office by virtue of birthright.\nThe connection between a republic and patriotism should be clear.\nMonarchical government is in a basic sense antithetical to patriotic citizenship.\"\nThe final chapter is a part summary part conclusion for the entire book.\nSoutphommasane observes that patriotism has increased in Australia in recent years, as events such as Australia Day in Sydney demonstrate.\nSoutphommasane argues that whilst patriotism has its dangers, \"it is no different to other forms of loyalty or love\".\nHe opines that patriotism is necessary for a thriving nation, as serves to form bonds between people which promote progress, direction and collective self-improvement.\nSoutphommasane writes that:\n\"People should be able to express national pride without being racist, while at the same time being able to criticise parts of the national story without being labelled un-Australian.\"\nThe book concludes with a restating of the need for progressives to re-think patriotism as an instrument of progress.\nThe book received high praise from Bob Carr, the Australian Literary Review, The Australian, the Sydney Morning Herald and The Age.\nHowever, Crikey!\nwriter Guy Rundle described \"Reclaiming Patriotism\" as a \"strange book\" which reveals an \"obsession with social control\u2009\" and a desire to \"legislate against the complex network of chauvinism and cultural privilege that makes up much of patriotism\".\nWrites Rundle:\n\"Soutphommasane has his own complex history, which suggests various reason why such a curiously contentless and lifeless alternative to real countrylove and social solidarity might appeal to him\u2009\u2014\u2009the aspiring dreamer amid the dreaming spires of Oxford has simply reprised the act of Petrach and the first nationalists\u2009\u2014\u2009the Renaissance thinkers who invented nationalism from their student clubs (\"the nations\") and then projected them back onto the regions they came from\".\nMark Bahnisch, agreeing with Rundle, made the following comment on his blog Larvatus Prodeo:\n\"it doesn\u2019t represent a viable political strategy for the left, for a whole range of reasons, including the basic failure whereby a project which transforms the social and the cultural cannot be substituted for by a fairly empty civics.\"\nThis book has not received any awards but had been nominated.\nShortlisted for the Community Relations Award in NSW Premier's Literary Awards in 2010.\nLonglisted John Button Prize 2010."}

leaving the guitar-driven bubblegum choruses to One Direction and letting The Wanted get on with their own brand of club-ready ladpop.\"\n\"Gotta Try It\", \"Hold Me Down\" and \"Give Me Life\" were named the best tracks, with the latter being compared to Chris Brown.\nKate Lucey of \"Sugarscape\" believed that JLS had \"...upped their game for Evolution; released R&B, urban flavoured pop, and mastered it\".\nShe called it \"their best record yet\" and gave it a perfect 10/10 rating.\nMaximum Pop said: \"All in all, a pretty solid album from Marvin & Co, as well as showing a significant progression of their overall musical style \u2013 they\u2019ve moved from their pop leanings and have fully embraced their role as an R&B group, something that\u2019ll help them separate from the growing pack of boybands out there, particularly against One Direction\u2019s guitar-based power pop and The Wanted\u2019s more clubby, experimental records.\nIt\u2019s an \u2018Evolution\u2019 alright, and we\u2019re definitely along for the ride.\"\nWriting for 4Music, Chris Younie was highly positive in his review: \"We've always known [JLS] were suave and sophisticated, but this has never been more evident than on this latest album.\nThe boys are back and they're cooler, crisper and cleverer than ever before.\nWe approve.\"\nLewis Corner of Digital Spy gave the album 3/5 stars.\nRegarding \"Hottest Girl in the World\", he said \"...it was a relief to hear the group ditch their tired R&B-dance hybrids to serve up a cool slice of Justin Timberlake-styled pop.\nTheir new attitude showed everyone that JLS are not shy about shaking off their boyish charm and transform into a charismatic manband.\"\nHe was critical of other tracks \"I Like It\" and \"Gotta Try It\", but admitted that \"Nevertheless, the result is an improvement on 2011's Jukebox and proves that JLS still have some mileage in them yet.\"\nIn a review for AllMusic, Matt Collar said: \"The fourth album from 2008 \"X Factor\" runner-up JLS, 2012's Evolution features more of the British boy band's slick, dance-oriented R&B.\nThis time, JLS have teamed up with big-name producers Mr. Bangladesh (Usher, T-Pain) and Rodney Jerkins (Michael Jackson, Justin Bieber).\nThe result is a synth-heavy album that evinces a kind of updated take on the '90s new jack swing influence that first inspired the group.\""}

Luhrmann in \"Persuasions of the Witch's Craft: Ritual Magic in Contemporary England\" (1989), in which she focused on a Wiccan coven and several ceremonial magic orders based in London.\nSociologist Allen Scarboro, psychologist Nancy Campbell and Wiccan literary critic Shirley Stave undertook fieldwork in the Ravenwood coven of Atlanta, Georgia, over several months across 1990 and 1991 as the basis for \"Living Witchcraft: A Contemporary American Coven\", published by Praeger in 1994, while anthropologist and Wiccan Loretta Orion investigated the Pagan movement in the East Coast and Midwest of the U.S. for \"Never Again the Burning Times: Paganism Revisited\", published by Waveland Press in 1995.\n1997 saw the publication of \"Witchcraft and Paganism in Australia\", authored by anthropologist Lynne Hume.\nAs a child, Greenwood had found a greater spiritual connection with the natural world than with organised religion.\nDuring the late 1970s, she embraced second-wave feminism and came across feminist forms of Pagan Witchcraft through Starhawk's \"\" (1982).\nAttracted to this new religious movement, she undertook an undergraduate degree in anthropology and sociology at Goldsmiths' College, where her final year research project focused on women's spirituality.\nExploring the topic in further depth, she devoted a PhD to the subject, thereby conducting the research underpinning \"Magic, Witchcraft and the Otherworld\".\nAlthough initially planning to gather data through formal taped interviews with participants, she rejected this method, believing it solidified her \"outsider\" status among the subculture she was studying.\nInstead, her data was collected through informal conversations with practitioners, during which she tried to make clear that she was an anthropologist and would use their comments in her work.\nOver the course of her research, Greenwood gained many friends within the city's Pagan community, and became sexually and emotionally attached to one magician.\nGreenwood's research was funded using grants from the University of London Central Research Fund and from the Economic and Social Research Council.\nShe devoted the published work to her children, Adrian and Lauren.\nChapter one describes contemporary Paganism and defines \"the otherworld\".\nIt discusses London's magical and Pagan subculture in the 1990s, and Greenwood's relationship with it.\nAdmitting to being an \"insider\", she explores her mixed feelings at being both a practicing Pagan and an anthropological observer.\nThe second chapter examines the community's conceptions of the otherworld, explaining how they approach it through acts of visualisation and altered states of consciousness and their understandings of it as a realm of spiritual energy connected to dreams and the imagination.\nDiscussing the relationship between anthropology and magic, Greenwood argues that it is impossible for anthropologists to truly understand beliefs regarding magic and the otherworld if they only view it through a western rationalist lens, instead arguing for a phenomenological or relativist perspective that accepts alternative views of the world.\nIn her third chapter, Greenwood examines her experiences among London's ceremonial magicians, focusing on her training in the Hermetic Qabalah, a \"magical language\" for exploring the otherworld.\nAdopting Luhrmann's concept of \"interpretative drift\", she relates how she shifted her understanding of events to make sense of her magical experiences.\nHowever, in contrast to Luhrmann's emphasis on how practitioners overcame their initial scepticism, Greenwood focuses on how these practitioners learn \"the language of another mode of reality\" through their experiences.\nChapter four details Greenwood's early involvement in Wicca, through three separate covens.\nOffering her thoughts on Wiccan invocations, she then discusses the faith's approach to sexual polarity, pointing to the sexual underpinnings of the Great Rite and the Gnostic Mass as evidence.\nThe chapter is rounded off with an explanation of how Wicca understands the natural world and a comparison between the religion and ceremonial magic.\nChapter five examines the attraction of magic for its practitioners, and its uses for psychotherapy and healing.\nGreenwood explores the ways in which occultists use magic as a rebellion against Christianity, and their construction of a \"magical identity\", believing this to be \"organized around a deep internal exploration of the self through an interaction with the otherworld\".\nShe also looks at magic and the acquisition of power, and the sense of empowerment discovered by magicians who were former abuse victims.\nThe sixth chapter focuses on notions of gender and sexuality, highlighting the widespread belief that sexual energy provides the power behind magic and discussing the contrasting views of Dion Fortune and Aleister Crowley on this issue; the former emphasised harmony and balance between \"masculine\" and \"feminine\" magical forces, while the latter advocated \"magical anarchy\" or spiritual autonomy for each individual, irrespective of gender.\nGreenwood looks at contrasting views on these issues in High Magic (ceremonial magic), Wicca and Feminist Witchcraft.\nDrawing upon the typologies advocated by sociologist of religion Susan J. Palmer, she argues that High Magic emphasises \"sex polarity\", a situation in which men and women are seen as unequal and different, whereas Wicca holds to a position of \"sex complementarity\", in which men and women are seen as different yet equal, and Feminist Witchcraft advocates \"sex unity\", in which there is a tolerance of sexual ambiguity.\nChapter seven deals with conceptions of morality and ethics, arguing that whereas High Magic typically envisions a dualistic world view of good versus evil, Wicca adheres to a monistic worldview in which malevolence and benevolence are seen as intrinsic parts of the whole.\nDisagreeing with Luhrmann's view that morality's place in the occult is to hide the pseudo-scientific nature of magic, Greenwood discusses how magic and witchcraft developed in Europe as a part of moral discourse.\nShe looks at the internal source of morality in High Magic, explaining concepts such as that of the Qliphoth, before examining the internal source of morality in Wicca and Feminist Witchcraft.\nGreenwood states that western esotericists have a holistic, animistic view of cosmology, considering the universe to be alive and interconnected with spiritual energies.\nAccording to such beliefs, many of these energies operate in \"a time and space distinct from, but also very closely connected to, everyday reality\", and it is this area that is termed the \"otherworld\" in Pagan discourse.\nShe relates that western esotericists believe in forces who inhabit this otherworld, and who are personalized as deities, animal guides, or spirit beings.\nShe furthermore states that these individuals see themselves as microcosms of the universal macrocosm.\nGreenwood highlights the practitioners' belief that they can interact with this otherworld and the entities which inhabit it through rituals that facilitate their own altered states of consciousness.\nShe notes that western magicians make use of mythology as a form of \"cognitive map\" to \"structure their otherworldy experience\".\nShe also notes that this otherworld is closely linked to dreams and the imagination in western magical belief.\nGreenwood argues that the academic discipline of anthropology, being a product of the western rationalism developed during the Age of Enlightenment, is innately skeptical of claims for the existence of magic or an otherworld, either among non-western cultures or western subcultures.\nIn contrast to this attitude, she notes that anthropology is the discipline which first pointed out that \"reality is culturally constructed\" and that there are \"multiple ways of experiencing the world\", including those which conceive of an otherworld existing alongside our own reality.\nFor this reason, she argues that anthropologists wishing to understand a society that believes in and practices magic must first tentatively accept the existence of an otherworld, claiming that \"it is inappropriate to use methods developed for the study of everyday reality to analyse the magical otherworld.\"\nGreenwood's text was reviewed by Patric V. Giesler of Gustavus Adolphus College for peer-reviewed academic journal \"American Ethnologist\".\nGiesler describes Greenwood's work as \"provocative\", noting that it represents a \"native's account\" of Paganism, with Greenwood being \"a native gone anthropologist.\"\nHe characterises Greenwood's experiences as religious or spiritual rather than magical, because none of the practices that she described involved manipulating beings or forces for an instrumental end; the classic definition of magic.\nUnconvinced by her argument that practitioner's notions of identity, gender and morality derived from their encounter with the otherworld, he considers other sources for such notions, but otherwise recommended the book.\nThe book was also reviewed by religious studies scholar Michael York of Bath Spa University for the \"Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion\".\nLabelling it an \"enormously engaging, provocative, and rich book\", he notes that readers may wish that Greenwood had more explicitly presented \"the antipatriarchal assumptions and their shortcomings\" of Feminist Witchcraft.\nComparing it with Luhrmann's \"Persuasions of the Witch's Craft\", York comments that it is a \"discerningly astute, nonretreating, thoroughly enjoyable, and highly recommended work.\"\nSarah M. Pike of the California State University, Chico reviewed the book for \"Culture and Religion: An Interdisciplinary Journal\", describing it as an \"accessible and personal account\".\nBelieving that it made an \"important contribution\" to Pagan studies and the anthropological study of magic, she nevertheless thought that Greenwood's subjective attitude was the book's shortcoming as well as its strength.\nPike finds problems in Greenwood's insider-outsider status, believing that it has not been sufficiently theorised, and that Greenwood was unaware of her own bias in favour of Feminist Witchcraft, which in turn affects her interpretation of other forms of Wicca and ceremonial magic.\nShe also critiques the book's lack of commentary or detailed analysis, complaining that many subsections lack conclusions.\nAnthropologist Galina Lindquist of the University of Stockholm published a review in \"The Australian Journal of Anthropology\", referring to \"Magic, Witchcraft and the Otherworld\" as \"a welcome contribution\" containing \"valuable\" ethnographic material.\nNoting that it joins the work of anthropologists like Jeanne Favret-Saada, Paul Stoller, and E. Turner, Lindquist praises the manner in which Greenwood put contemporary practices into historical perspective, and how she illuminates the \"strains and contradictions\" within the magical milieu.\nShe believes that Greenwood's arguments would have been strengthened had she made use of a more in-depth ethnographic study of magical morality, and considers it unfortunate that Greenwood had not touched on ritual studies.\nGreenwood's work was independently reviewed by two separate individuals in \"The Pomegranate: A New Journal of Neopagan Thought\" \u2013 then a scholarly but not yet academic publication.\nThe first reviewer, Daniel Cohen of \"Wood and Water\" magazine, praises Greenwood's theoretical approach, claiming that she had been \"braver\" than Luhrmann in maintaining a \"creative tension\" as both an insider and outsider.\nAsserting that Greenwood's use of anthropological terminology made for \"hard reading\", he suspects that her use of the word \"magician\" would jar with many Pagans who would disagree with the manner in which she used it.\nIn conclusion, he recommends it as a \"valuable but inexpensive book\".\n\"The Pomegranate\"'s second review came from Pagan studies scholar Douglas Ezzy of the University of Tasmania, who praises Greenwood's research, theoretical approach and style of writing.\nHe notes that her \"truly ground breaking\" approach in taking spiritual experiences seriously had \"fascinated and thrilled\" him, asserting that her work builds on the pioneering edited collection \"Being Changed\" by Jean-Guy Goulet and David E. Young.\nNoting that \"Magic, Witchcraft and the Otherworld\" was \"sometimes provocative\", he disagrees with some of Greenwood's conclusions, but highlights that her arguments had made him think about these issues \"in much sharper focus.\"\nReviewing it for his own website, prominent chaos magician Phil Hine described Greenwood's work as \"fascinating\", arguing that it should interest students of anthropology as well as practising occultists.\nHe praises the author's descriptions of her own experiences within esoteric groups, and the manner in which she highlighted the power struggles that take place within them, before recommending it as \"an engaging and thought-provoking read\"."}

) was a king of Georgia, reigning from 1270 until his execution by the Mongol Ilkhans in 1289.\nHe was a son of David VII of Georgia by his third wife Gvantsa Kakhaberidze.\nDemetrius, although a Christian, was polygamous, with three wives, and was survived by nine children, of whom three subsequently ruled as kings of Georgia.\nDemetrius, born in 1259, was the second son and third child of King David VII.\nHis mother was David's third wife Gvantsa n\u00e9e Kakhaberidze.\nHe was only 3 or 4 years old when Gvantsa was put to death by the Mongols as a reaction to David's abortive rebellion against the Ilkhan hegemony.\nDavid himself died in 1270.\nDemetrius had an elder half-brother George, an heir apparent, who died before his father's death in 1268, and an elder half-sister Tamar, whom Demetrius subsequently married off, with great reluctance, to a son of the Mongol official Arghun-Agha.\nOn Arghun's death, Tamar, who despised her marriage, capitalized on her husband's departure from Tbilisi and fled to the mountains of Mtiuleti.\nShe was eventually delivered by Demetrius' powerful minister Sadun Mankaberdeli, a polygamous, who wed her through the intercession of the Ilkhan Abaqa.\nThe anonymous 14th-century \"Chronicle of a Hundred Years\", part of the Georgian Chronicles, states that Demetrius, previously a pious Christian, allowed himself to come under the influence of the Mongol \"bad habits\".\nThe young king enjoyed, to the dismay of the Georgian catholicos Nicholas III, no less than three wives, his polygamy becoming the occasion of that prelate's abdication in 1282.\nAt the time of Demetrius' death at the hand of the Mongols in 1289, all three of his wives, as well as their children, were alive.\nThe first of Demetrius' wives was a Trapezuntine princess, whom he married c. 1273\u20131274 or 1277.\nHer name and parentage are not recorded in the medieval sources.\nShe might have been a daughter of the emperor Manuel I of Trebizond by his wife Irene Syrikaina, and was probably called Theodora or Irene.\nIn contrast to Demetrius' other wives, she is invariably referred to by the medieval chronicler as \"the queen\", indicating that she enjoyed the status of the king's principal consort.\nBy this woman, Demetrius had four sons, David VIII, Vakhtang III, Lasha, and Manuel, and a daughter named Rusudan.\nAfter Demetrius' demise, the Ilkhan Arghun assigned the valley of Skoreti near Tbilisi for the support of the Georgian queen, who kept by her her two young sons, Manuel and Lasha.\nIn 1298, she was part of negotiations with the Mongol general Kutlushah sent by the Ilkhan Arghun against her son David VIII.\nOf the children of this marriage, David VIII succeeded his cousin Vakhtang II as king of Georgia in 1292, but continued as a co-king with his younger brother Vakhtang III (r. 1301\u20131307) and his own son, George VI the Little (r. 1307\u20131318), until his death in 1310.\nManuel is known from the Georgian annals to have been involved in the mission to Kutlushah in 1298.\nHe was married to Mamkan, a daughter of his tutor Tarsaich Orbelian, Prince of Syunik and Atabag of Georgia, as recorded by Tarsaich's son Stephen in his chronicle.\nManuel died in 1314, without known issue.\nThe only daughter born of Demetrius' first marriage, Rusudan, was married off by his father to a son of his ally, the influential Mongol statesman Buqa.\nRusudan appears to have survived the demise of Buqa and his family in 1289, later remarrying Taqa, a Georgian nobleman of the house of Panaskerteli.\nRusudan and Taqa are known as benefactors of the Monastery of the Cross in Jerusalem.\nFurthermore, Rusudan is identified with the \"queen of queens Rusudan\" mentioned, along with the late Taqa, in an inscription from the Gudarekhi monastery.\nDemetrius' second wife was the Mongol woman Solghar, by whom he had two sons, Baidu and Yadgar, and a daughter, Jigda.\nFollowing the death of Demetrius, she retired from Georgia, bringing Baidu and Yadgar with her to her father's home in \"Tartary\".\nBaidu then reappears in the Georgian annals as an envoy of his half-brother David VIII to the khan of the Golden Horde, Toqta, in 1298.\nAccording to one genealogical hypothesis, Jigda is the same as Jiajak, the second wife of the emperor Alexios II of Trebizond.\nDemetrius married thirdly, c. 1280, Natela, a daughter of Beka I Jaqeli, Duke of Samtskhe and Lord High Steward of Georgia.\nAfter the death of Demetrius, she returned to her father's court, where the only child of Demetrius and Natela, George V, was reared until his appointment as a co-king with his half-brother David VIII in 1299.\nHe became regent for his nephew, George the Little, in 1307, and replaced him as king-regnant in 1318.\nHe was to become the most famous of Demetrius' sons, earning the sobriquet \"the Illustrious\" for the unity and relative prosperity he brought to his country after a century of the Mongol domination."}

Broccoli\u2014known to all as Cubby\u2014disagreed with Fleming's view, later commenting that \"I wanted a ballsy guy\u00a0... put a bit of veneer over that tough Scottish hide and you've got Fleming's Bond instead of all the mincing poofs we had applying for the job\".\nEon's choice of Connery was also based on his looks and sex appeal, an appeal that would later be echoed by Honor Blackman who said, after appearing with Connery in \"Goldfinger\", \"He was exceedingly handsome, virile and sexy and that really was the tenor of what the script was always trying to display\".\nAfter Connery was chosen, director Terence Young took the actor to his tailor and hairdresser, and introduced him to the high life, restaurants, casinos and women of London.\nIn the words of Bond writer Raymond Benson, Young educated the actor \"in the ways of being dapper, witty, and above all, cool\".\nConnery's interpretation of the character differed considerably from Fleming's, being more promiscuous and cold-blooded than the literary version.\nConnery described Bond as \"a complete sensualist\u2014senses highly tuned, awake to everything, quite amoral.\nI particularly like him because he thrives on conflict\".\nAcademic James Chapman observed that for \"Dr. No\", Connery's interpretation of the character, although not complete, showed the actor \"should be credited with having established a new style of performance: a British screen hero in the manner of an American leading man\".\nIn his second film, \"From Russia with Love\", Connery looked less nervous and edgy; he gave \"a relaxed, wry performance of subtle wit and style\".\nPfeiffer and Worrall noted that Connery \"personified James Bond with such perfection that even Ian Fleming\u00a0... admitted that it was difficult imagining anyone else in the part\"; academic Jeremy Black agreed and declared that \"Connery made the role his own and created the Bond audience for the cinema\".\nBlack also observed that Connery gave the character a \"spare, pared-down character\u00a0... [with] inner bleakness along with the style\".\nConnery played Bond with \"the right mix of cool charisma, violence and arrogance\u00a0... against which all others are judged\".\nRaymond Benson perceived that Connery \"embodies a ruggedness and an intense screen presence this transcends any preconceived notions about the character\".\nBenson also noted that Bond was witty, but contains \"an assured toughness that epitomises the machismo male\".\nRoger Moore agreed with Black and Benson, commenting that \"Sean \"was\" Bond.\nHe created Bond.\nHe embodied Bond and because of Sean, Bond became an instantly recognisable character the world over\u2014he was rough, tough, mean and witty\u00a0... he was a bloody good 007\".\nHowever, despite his charm and virility, Connery was characteristically laconic in his delivery.\nChristopher Bray says of him that \"in his single-minded, laconic, mocking, self-sufficient vanity, Connery's Bond was the epitome of sixties consumer culture\".\nInterviewed by Oriana Fallaci in 1965, Connery identified where he had altered the character for the films, saying \"I said to the producers that the character had one defect, there was no humor about him; to get him accepted, they'd have to let me play him tongue-in-cheek, so people could laugh.\nThey agreed, and there you are: today Bond is accepted to such an extent that even philosophers take the trouble to analyze him, even intellectuals enjoy defending him or attacking him.\nAnd even while they're laughing at him, people take him terribly seriously\".\nConnery went on to add that \"Bond is important: this invincible superman that every man would like to copy, that every woman would like to conquer, this dream we all have of survival.\nAnd then one can't help liking him\".\nAfter the pressures of five films in six years, Connery left the role after the 1967 film \"You Only Live Twice\" saying, \"It became a terrible pressure, like living in a goldfish bowl\u00a0... that was part of the reason I wanted to be finished with Bond.\nAlso I had become completely identified with it, and it became very wearing and very boring\".\nAfter a hiatus of one film\u2014\"On Her Majesty's Secret Service\", in which George Lazenby played Bond\u2014Connery returned to the role for \"Diamonds Are Forever\" after David Picker, the head of United Artists, made it clear that Connery was to be enticed back to the role and that money was no object.\nWhen approached about resuming the role of Bond, Connery demanded\u2014and received\u2014a fee of \u00a31.25 million (\u00a3 million in pounds), 12.5% of the gross profits and, as a further enticement, United Artists offered to back two films of his choice.\nHis performance received mixed reviews, with Raymond Benson considering that Connery \"looks weary and bored\u00a0... he is overweight, slow-moving, and doesn't seem to be trying to create a credible character\".\nDespite that, Benson considers that Connery \"still radiates more screen presence than Roger Moore or George Lazenby\".\nOn the other hand, Pauline Kael said \"Connery's James Bond is less lecherous than before and less foppish\u2014and he's better this way\".\nIn the early 1980s producer Jack Schwartzman moved ahead with a non-Eon Bond film, following the controversy over the 1961 novel \"Thunderball\" and the subsequent long legal battle; the result was \"Never Say Never Again\".\nConnery accepted an offer to play Bond once more, asking for (and receiving) a fee of $3 million ($ million in dollars), a percentage of the profits, as well as casting, director and script approval.\nThe script has several references to Bond's advancing years\u2014playing on Connery being 52 at the time of filming.\nDavid Robinson, reviewing the film for \"The Times\" considered that, \"Connery\u00a0... is back, looking hardly a day older or thicker, and still outclassing every other exponent of the role, in the goodnatured throwaway with which he parries all the sex and violence on the way\".\nIn 2003, Bond, as portrayed by Connery, was selected as the third-greatest hero in cinema history by the American Film Institute.\nWhen Sean Connery had been cast in November 1961, David Niven had been Fleming's choice for the role as the actor reflected his image of the character.\nIn 1965 producer Charles Feldman signed Niven to play Sir James Bond for \"Casino Royale\", a film not made by Eon Productions.\nConnery and Peter Sellers had both turned down the role.\nNiven was 56 when he played Bond and his characterisation was that of an elderly man who had won the Victoria Cross at the Siege of Mafeking, had a daughter by his lover, the spy Mata Hari, played Claude Debussy on the piano, ate royal jelly and cultivated black roses.\nThe concept of Bond is that once Niven's Bond retired, his name and 007 designation was passed to another agent to keep the legend alive; James Chapman notes that the implication was that the \"other Bond\" was that played by Connery.\nChapman considered the concept of an elderly Bond interesting, with Bond referring to Connery's Bond as a \"sexual acrobat who leaves a trail of beautiful dead women behind like blown roses\".\nIn line with the literary Bond, Niven's character drives a vintage Bentley, rather than the Aston Martin favoured by Connery.\nBond scholar Steven Jay Rubin thought Niven perfectly cast as the retired Bond, and saw him as \"a throw-back to the hell-for-leather adventure heroes\" of the character, which paralleled Niven's own life and career.\nBarnes and Hearn describe this as a \"perfectly fair interpretation\", given the way Niven approached the role, while Raymond Benson thinks casting Niven was \"intelligent\".\nJeremy Black questioned the use of Niven in the role, observing that he did not seem to be a killer, and did not have the \"disconcerting edge\" that Connery had.\nWith the departure of Connery after \"You Only Live Twice\", Broccoli and director Peter R. Hunt chose Australian George Lazenby to play the role of Bond.\nHe first came to their attention after seeing him in a Fry's Chocolate Cream advertisement.\nLazenby dressed the part by sporting several sartorial Bond elements such as a Rolex Submariner wristwatch and a Savile Row suit (ordered, but uncollected, by Connery), and going to Connery's barber at the Dorchester Hotel.\nLazenby consolidated his claim during a screen test, when he accidentally punched a professional wrestler, who was acting as stunt coordinator, in the face, impressing Broccoli with his ability to display aggression.\nLazenby never signed a contract, with negotiations dragging on during production, and he was subsequently convinced by his agent Ronan O'Rahilly that the secret agent would be archaic in the liberated 1970s; as a result he left the role before the release of \"On Her Majesty's Secret Service\" in 1969.\nFor his performance as Bond, Lazenby was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for New Star of the Year \u2013 Actor at the 27th Golden Globe Awards.\nCritical opinion was split about Lazenby; he has been considered to have been the worst Bond, and has variously been described as \"laconic and humourless\", \"a little stiff\" and \"annoying and smug\".\nDerek Malcolm of \"The Guardian\" was dismissive of Lazenby's performance, saying that he \"is not a good actor and though I never thought Sean Connery was all that stylish either, there are moments when one yearns for a little of his louche panache\".\n\"The New York Times\" critic AH Weiler also weighed in against Lazenby, saying that \"Lazenby, if not a spurious Bond, is merely a casual, pleasant, satisfactory replacement\".\nPauline Kael called Lazenby \"quite a dull fellow\" in her otherwise positive review in \"The New Yorker\".\nHowever, Peter R. Hunt, director of \"On Her Majesty's Secret Service\", stated that Lazenby should have undertaken more films in the role, saying \"he would have made a very credible Bond and been very good indeed\".\nSmith and Lavington consider that Lazenby \"had chosen to play Bond the same way as Sean Connery had, with perhaps more humility and humanity\"; they went on to say that \"Lazenby's inexperience rarely shows\" in the film, and that \"he invariably rises to the occasion\".\nAlexander Walker in the \"London Evening Standard\" said that, \"The truth is that George Lazenby is almost as good a James Bond as the man referred to in his film as 'the other fellow'.\nLazenby's voice is more suave than sexy-sinister and he could pass for the other fellow's twin on the shady side of the casino.\nBond is now definitely all set for the Seventies\".\nJudith Crist of \"New York Magazine\" commented that, \"This time around there's less suavity and a no-nonsense muscularity and maleness to the role via the handsome Mr. Lazenby\".\nFeminist film critic Molly Haskell wrote an approving review in the \"Village Voice\": \"Lazenby\u00a0... seems more comfortable in a wet tuxedo than a dry martini, more at ease as a donnish genealogist than reading (or playing) \"Playboy\", and who actually dares to think that one woman who is his equal is better than a thousand part-time playmates\".\nJames Chapman considers that Lazenby looks the part of Bond, identifying his athleticism and \"arrogant swagger\", which \"convey the snobbery of the character\".\nChapman also distinguished a more vulnerable and human characterisation in Bond\u2014feeling exhausted and falling in love\u2014as opposed to the \"heroic superman\" of Connery.\nBrian Fairbanks noted that \"\"OHMSS\" gives us a James Bond capable of vulnerability, a man who can show fear and is not immune to heartbreak.\nLazenby is that man, and his performance is superb\".\nBen Macintyre also observed that of all the Bonds, Lazenby's characterisation was closest to that of Fleming's original character.\nAfter \"Diamonds Are Forever\", Broccoli and Saltzman tried to convince Sean Connery to return as Bond, but he declined.\nAfter considering Jeremy Brett, Michael Billington and Julian Glover, the two producers finally turned to Roger Moore, who they had previously discussed for \"On Her Majesty's Secret Service\", but who had been unavailable, and he was ultimately cast to play Bond in \"Live and Let Die\".\nAt the time Moore was an established television actor, known for his performances as Simon Templar in \"The Saint\" and Lord Brett Sinclair in \"The Persuaders!\n\": in both of which he played a \"charming, debonair, international playboy\".\nWhen playing Bond, Moore tried not to imitate either Connery or his previous roles, and screenwriter Tom Mankiewicz fitted the screenplay around Moore's persona by giving more comedy scenes and a light-hearted feel to Bond, an approach that led Raymond Benson to describe Moore's Bond as \"a rather smarmy, eyebrow-raising international playboy who never seemed to get hurt\".\nFilm writer Andrew Spicer considered Roger Moore the most elegant and mannerly of the Bonds, with the voice and style of an English debonair country gentleman.\nBenson agreed, stating that Moore was, \"too nice and well-mannered to be a James Bond of any real substance\", while Doug Pratt said that \"the writers worked out an amenable personality for Roger Moore and found a breezy balance between comedy and action\".\nTo make Moore's character appear tougher, a Smith & Wesson .44 Magnum \u2014 which at the time was associated with the macho image of the Clint Eastwood character, Dirty Harry \u2014 was chosen for Moore to use in \"Live and Let Die\" rather than Bond's usual choice of Walther PPK.\nSpicer says \"Roger Moore re-created Bond as an old-style debonair hero, more polished and sophisticated than Connery's incarnation, using the mocking insouciance he had perfected in his role as Simon Templar\u00a0... Moore's humour was a throwaway, and certainly in the later films, verged on self-parody.\nIt was an essential strand in the increasingly tongue-in-cheek direction of the series which became more light-hearted, knowing and playfully intertextual\".\nChapman noted that Moore was the most comedic of the Bonds, with a more light-hearted approach to playing the character with a mocking wit and innuendo.\nAdditionally, Moore's one-liners were delivered in a way to suggest that the violence inherent in the films was a joke, as opposed to Connery's, which was used to mitigate the violence.\nMoore explained his approach to the humour by saying \"to me, the Bond situations are so ridiculous\u00a0...\nI mean, this man is supposed to be a spy, and yet everybody knows he's a spy\u00a0... it's outrageous.\nSo you have to treat the humour outrageously as well\".\nPauline Kael was a fairly vocal critic of Moore's, dismissing him as an \"iceberg\" in \"The Man with the Golden Gun\".\nIn reviewing \"For Your Eyes Only\", she wrote \"Roger Moore is Bond again, and his idea of Bond's imperturbable cool is the same as playing dead\".\nReviewing \"Moonraker\", she wrote \"Roger Moore is dutiful and passive as Bond; his clothes are neatly pressed and he shows up for work, like an office manager who is turning into dead wood but hanging on to collect his pension\".\nOnly in \"The Spy Who Loved Me\", one of Kael's favourite Bond films, did she praise him describing him as self-effacing: \"Moore gets the chance to look scaredan emotion that suits him and makes him more likable\".\nA number of Moore's personal preferences were transferred into his characterisation of Bond: his taste for Cuban cigars and his wearing of safari suits were assigned to the character.\nMoore's use for cigars in his early films put him in contrast to the cigarette-smoking Connery, Lazenby and Dalton.\nBy the time of Moore's fifth film, \"For Your Eyes Only\", released in 1981, his characterisation had come to represent an old-fashioned character, in contrast to the fashionability Connery had brought to the role in the 1960s.\nIn 1985 Moore appeared in his seventh and final film, \"A View to a Kill\"; he was 57 (he appeared alongside co-star Tanya Roberts, who was 30).\nCritics focused on Moore's age: \"The Washington Post\" said \"Moore isn't just long in the tooth \u2013 he's got tusks, and what looks like an eye job has given him the pie-eyed blankness of a zombie.\nHe's not believable anymore in the action sequences, even less so in the romantic scenes\".\nWhen he was cast for the film, Moore recalled that he felt \"a bit long in the tooth\", and in December 2007 admitted that he \"was only about four hundred years too old for the part\".\nLike Connery, Moore appeared as Bond in seven films; by the time he retired in 1985, he was the oldest actor to play 007 in the Eon series, and his Bond films had earned over at the box office.\nWith the retirement of Roger Moore in 1985, a search for a new actor to play Bond took place that saw a number of actors, including Sam Neill, Pierce Brosnan and Timothy Dalton, audition for the role in 1986.\nBond co-producer Michael G. Wilson, director John Glen, Dana and Barbara Broccoli \"were impressed with Sam Neill and very much wanted to use him\", although Bond producer Albert R. Broccoli was not sold on the actor.\nDalton and Brosnan were both considered by Eon, but after Brosnan was eventually ruled out by his Remington Steele contract, Dalton was appointed in August 1986 on a salary of $5.2\u00a0million.\nWhen he was either 24 or 25 years old Dalton had discussed playing Bond with Broccoli, but decided he was too young to accept the role, thinking Bond should be played between 35 and 40 years old.\nIn preparing for the role, Dalton, a green-eyed, dark haired, slender, 6'2\" (1 m 88\u00a0cm) classically trained Shakespearean actor, was keen to portray the character as accurately as possible, reading up extensively on the books before his role in \"The Living Daylights\" (1987).\nDalton's Bond was a serious one: dark, cold, emotional, stern, ruthless, showing little humour, and focused as a killer with little time for fun and indulgence.\nDalton's interpretation of the character came from his \"desire to see a darker Bond\", one that was \"less of a womaniser, tougher and closer to the darker character Ian Fleming wrote about\".\nJames Chapman also considered Dalton closer to Fleming's Bond than the previous actors, writing that Dalton was \"clearly less comfortable\u00a0... with the witty asides and one-liners\u00a0... so he becomes something closer to the Bond of the books, who rarely develops a sense of humour\".\nWhen reviewing \"Licence to Kill\", Iain Johnstone of \"The Sunday Times\" disagreed, declaring that \"any vestiges of the gentleman spy\u00a0... by Ian Fleming\" have now gone; he went on to say that \"this character is remarkably close both in deed and action to the eponymous hero of the new \"Batman\" film\".\nNot all viewers were taken with Dalton.\nJay Scott of \"The Globe and Mail\" was entirely dismissive.\n\"The new Bond has been widely described in feature stories as a throwback to the Ian Fleming original (studying the Fleming novels, Dalton was pleased to discover that Bond was a human being, he says), and that may be true, if the Fleming original lacked charm, sex appeal and wit.\nTimothy Dalton's Bond is a serious bloke who swallows his words and approaches his job with responsibility and humanity, and eschews promiscuity \u2013 Dirtless Harry.\nYou get the feeling that on his off nights, he might curl up with the Reader's Digest and catch an episode of Moonlighting \u2013 he'd try to memorize the jokes \u2013 before nodding off under the influence of Ovaltine.\nThe British reviews of \"The Living Daylights\" have been laudatory, perhaps because this Bond is the most British of all, if British is to be understood as a synonym for reserved\".\nRaymond Benson noted that Dalton \"purposely played Bond as a ruthless and serious man with very little of the wit displayed by Connery, Lazenby or Moore\", and considered him \"the most accurate and literal interpretation of the role\u00a0... ever seen on screen\".\nHis character also reflected a degree of moral ambiguity; in \"Licence to Kill\", for instance, he becomes a rogue agent, while Dalton himself saw the character as a \"man, not a superhuman; a man who is beset with moral confusions and apathies and uncertainties, and who is often very frightened and nervous and tense\".\nSmith and Lavington observed that during Dalton's portrayal in \"Licence to Kill\", Bond appeared \"self-absorbed\u00a0... reckless, brutal, prone to nervous laughter and\u00a0... probably insane, or at least seriously disturbed.\nIn the light of \"Licence to Kill\", one academic, Martin Willis, referred to Dalton's Bond as a \"muscular vigilante\".\nSteven Jay Rubin noted that Dalton's films had \"a hard-edged reality and some unflinching violent episodes that were better suited to Dalton's more realistic approach to the character\".\nRubin considered Dalton's portrayal \"Fleming's Bond\u00a0... the suffering Bond\".\nIn contrast to the previous incarnations of the character, Smith and Lavington identified Dalton's humour as \"brooding rather than flippant\"; combined with his heavy smoking, they considered him \"an effective leading man\".\nAlthough Bond screenwriter Richard Maibaum called Sean Connery the best Bond, he considered Dalton the best actor of the four he worked with.Tom Mankiewicz agreed with this view, praising Dalton's androgynous facets.His predecessor, Roger Moore also felt that Dalton was the best actor to play Bond.\nDirector John Glen also felt that Dalton was the best actor that portrayed Bond, and that he was ahead of his time, noting the comparisons between Daniel Craig's incarnation to that of Dalton's.\nDalton's films did not perform as well at the box office as most of the previous films.\nCommentators such as \"Screen International\" considered the Bond series had run its course in the age of series such as Indiana Jones and \"Lethal Weapon\".\nEdward P. Comentale observed that \"Dalton, for all his occasional flat northern vowels, was probably too much the stage actor to be convincing as an action hero in the age of Willis, Schwarzenegger and Stallone\".\nAfter just two films\u2014\"The Living Daylights\" and \"Licence to Kill\"\u2014litigation ensued over the licensing of the Bond catalogue, delaying what would have been Dalton's third film by several years.\nHis six-year contract expired in 1993 and he left the series in 1994.\nAfter Timothy Dalton retired from the Bond role in 1994, Eon turned to the actor they had considered after \"A View to a Kill\": Pierce Brosnan.\nHe was offered a three-film contract, with an option on a fourth; his salary for his first film, \"GoldenEye\", was $4\u00a0million, which rose to $16.5\u00a0million for his fourth and final outing, \"Die Another Day\".\nBrosnan had first met Broccoli on the set of \"For Your Eyes Only\", when Brosnan's wife, Cassandra Harris, was appearing in the film as Countess Lisl von Schlaf, and the couple lunched with Broccoli during filming.\nBrosnan went on to play a criminal-turned-private investigator in \"Remington Steele\" in the 1980s, where he captured some of the traits of previous Bonds in playing the role: like Moore, he exemplified a high degree of suavity, elegance, charm and wit, but displayed a masculinity and grittiness on occasion reminiscent of Connery's Bond, both successfully \"combine the character's Englishness with a classless internationalism that is highly knowing\".\nAndrew Spicer says that \"Brosnan's frame carries the 'Armani look' with its refined understated Englishness, to perfection.\nHis lithe, sinuous athleticism is well suited to the fast-paced action and state-of-the-art gadgetry that retains the series' core appeal\".\nJames Chapman also considered Brosnan's appearance striking, saying the actor had \"old-fashioned, darkly handsome matinee idol looks\".\nWith Brosnan, the Bond writers knew that because of the changes in public attitudes, he could not be as overtly sexual and dominant over women as Connery's Bond, and was denounced by M in \"GoldenEye\" as a \"sexist, misogynist dinosaur, a relic of the Cold War\".\nBrosnan was seen by many as the quintessential James Bond in appearance and manner; displaying an air of coolness, elegance and a grace which made him believable as an international playboy, if not purely as an assassin.\nJohn G. Stackhouse for instance argues that it is preposterous that any man as strikingly handsome as Brosnan and Connery could be a secret agent, saying, \"When Sean Connery or Pierce Brosnan enters a room, everyone notices.\nThus it is ridiculous to suppose that James Bond, looking like that, could be a secret agent for longer than about two seconds\".\nBrosnan's Bond was introduced in \"GoldenEye\"; James Chapman argues that the film works his portrayal of Bond into the history of the others in the series through the post-credits sequence use of the , previously seen in \"Goldfinger\" and \"Thunderball\", \"thus immediately evoking the memory of [Sean] Connery\".\nBrosnan's characterisation of Bond was seen by Jeremy Black as being \"closer to the Fleming novels than Moore\u00a0... yet he is also lighter and less intense than Dalton\".\nBlack also commented that the shift in character in the first three films reflected changing social opinions, with Bond not smoking.\nBrosnan was clear he wanted to change Bond's smoking habit, saying \"I don't give a damn about everyone's perception of the character: I think smoking causes cancer therefore he doesn't smoke\", although he did smoke a Cuban cigar in \"Die Another Day\".\nBrosnan continued with the use of humour prevalent with other portrayals, and provided a \"mix of action and danger threaded through with the right amount of wit and humour\"; Smith and Lavington saw the humour largely as puns that were \"flippant, but not crass\".\nAfter four films in the role, Brosnan stated he wished to do one final Bond film.\nAlthough plans were made for a film to be released in 2004, negotiations stalled and Brosnan announced his intention to leave in July 2004.\nOn 14 October 2005 Eon Productions, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and Sony Pictures Entertainment introduced at a press conference in London Daniel Craig as the sixth actor to portray Bond in the Eon series.\nA tuxedo- and lifejacket-clad Craig arrived via a Royal Navy speedboat.\nCraig accepted the role based on the strength of the script for \"Casino Royale\"; he later recalled that \"once I sat down and read the story, I just thought that I wanted to tell [it]\u00a0...\nI'm a big Bond fan, and I love what he represents\".\nSignificant controversy followed the decision, with some critics and fans expressing doubt the producers had made the right choice.\nThroughout the entire production period, Internet campaigns such as danielcraigisnotbond.com expressed their dissatisfaction and threatened to boycott the film in protest.\nCraig, unlike previous actors, was not considered by the protesters to fit the tall, dark, handsome and charismatic image of Bond to which viewers had been accustomed.\nMany disparagingly called him \"James Blonde\", believing the blond-haired blue-eyed rugged Craig far from the traditional tall, dark and suave actors who had earlier portrayed him.\nThe \"Daily Mirror\" ran a front-page news story critical of Craig, with the headline, \"The Name's Bland \u2013 James Bland\".\nCraig first played Bond in the 2006 film \"Casino Royale\", an adaptation of Fleming's novel of the same name and a reboot of the Eon series, which saw Bond earn his 00 status.\nDespite the negative press on his appointment, Craig was widely praised by critics and former Bonds after the release of the film, many of whom believed he was the first actor to truly nail Fleming's character in the book.\nTodd McCarthy, reviewing the film for \"Variety\", considered that \"Craig comes closer to the author's original conception of this exceptionally long-lived male fantasy figure than anyone since early Sean Connery\", and he went on to say that \"Craig once and for all claims the character as his own\", while Steven Spielberg called Craig \"the perfect 21st-century Bond\".\nPaul Arendt, writing for the BBC, agreed, observing that \"Daniel Craig is not a good Bond.\nHe's a \"great\" Bond.\nSpecifically, he is 007 as conceived by Ian Fleming\u2014a professional killing machine, a charming, cold-hearted patriot with a taste for luxury.\nCraig is the first actor to really nail 007's defining characteristic: he's an absolute swine\".\nJames Chapman commented on the realism and violence in the film noting that Bond is seen to seriously bleed for the first time in the series; Chapman also identified a number of violent scenes which make \"Casino Royale\" notable in the series.\nIn 2012 \"Skyfall\" was released: it was Craig's third outing as 007.\nReviewing the film, Philip French, writing in \"The Observer\", considered that Craig managed to \"get out of the shadow of Connery\", while the \"New Statesman\" thought that he had \"relaxed into Bond without losing any steeliness\".\nFootnotes\nCitations"}

Ga\u1e47abachi or Ga\u1e47apati (Ganapati is a popular epithet of Ganesha) and Ga\u1e47wha (Ganesha).\nLike Ganesha, Bin\u0101yaka is the remover of obstacles, but when propitiated, he bestows material fortunes, prosperity, success and health.\nIn addition, Bin\u0101yaka is said to be of evil nature, creator of discord and dispute and leading people towards immoral ways.\nSh\u014d-ten or \u0100ryadeva indicates his association with good luck and fortune.\nThe name \"Kangi-ten\", generally implied to the Tantric embracing deity icons, is venerated as giver of joy and prosperity.\nThe Dual Kangiten icon called Soshin Kangi-ten (\"dual-bodied god of bliss\") is a unique feature of Shingon Buddhism.\nIt is also called Soshin Binayaka in Japanese, Huanxitian in Chinese and Nandikeshvara in Sanskrit.\nKangiten is often represented as an elephant-headed male and female pair, standing embracing each other in sexual union.\nThe genders of the pair is not explicit, but hinted in the iconography.\nThe female wears a crown, a patched monk's robe and a red surplice, while the male wears a black cloth over his shoulder.\nHe has a long trunk and tusks, while she has short ones.\nHe is reddish-brown in colour and she is white.\nShe usually rests her feet on his, while he rests his head on her shoulder.\nA variant form called \"Shoten Fondly Smiling\" form, both of them gaze into each other's eyes, smiling intently.\nShe wears loose garments, while he wears tight ones.\nSometimes, they are cloaked in a single garment.\nIn another variant, \"Embracing Shoten Looking Over the Shoulder\", as the name suggests, the couple look over each other's shoulders.\nThe iconography represents unity of opposites (coniunctio oppositorum).\nThough they are separate figures with contrasting iconographies and genders, however they share the common name \"Kangiten\" and are engrossed in an intimate embrace, indicating their nonduality.\nThe non-dual is further stressed by sexual indicators like the feet-on-feet or the single garment.\nShoten may be also depicted as male alone.\nThe deity figure(s) is/are portrayed as elephant-headed, with two, four, six, eight or twelve arms.\nHowever, his images are rarely displayed in public.\nWhen depicted as a male, Shoten is generally four-armed, holding a radish and a sweet (modak).\nHe may also hold a mace, a sword, a cup of ambrosia or have two of his front arms folded.\nThe six-armed aspect of Kangiten is described carrying a knife, a fruit bowl, a discus in his left hands and a club, a noose and his broken tusk in his right.\nVinayaka are also depicted in two most important Shingon mandalas, Vajra-dhatu and Garbhakosa-dhatu.\nThe mandalas generally have more than 1 Vinayaka figures.\nThe Vinayakas are elephant-headed, carry emblems such as radish and axe and are seated on lotus pedestals (\"padmasana\"), the sign of divinity.\nThe Vinayakas are generally positioned as guardians of the directions and serve as protectors against demons and evil.\nThe central figure of the mandalas is Vairocana, one of the Five Great Buddhas, whose incarnation the Vinayakas are considered in this configuration.\nKangiten may also be depicted symbolically by symbolic syllable called \"shuji\" or bija or by symbols such as an umbrella, garland or bow and arrow in mandalas.\nKangiten first emerged as a minor deity in the Japanese Buddhist pantheon in the eighth-ninth centuries CE, possibly under the influence of Kukai (774\u2013835), the founder of Shingon Buddhism.\nThe Hindu Ganesha icon travelled to China, where it was incorporated in Buddhism, then journeyed further to Japan.\nKangiten's early role in Shingon, like most other Hindu deities assimilated in Buddhism, is of a minor guardian of the twin mandalas.\nLater on, Kangiten emerged as \"besson\", an independent deity.\nKangiten appears in numerous Japanese \"besson\" guides, compiled in Heian period (794\u20131185).\nWhile it includes rituals and iconographic forms like the early Chinese texts, it introduces origin myths of the deity to justify the Buddhist nature of the Hindu Ganesha.\nEarly images show him as with two or six arms.\nThe paintings and gilt-bronze images of the Dual Kangiten with explicit sexual connotations emerged in the late Heian period, under the Tantric influence of Tibetan Buddhism where such sexual imagery (Yab-Yum) was common.\nThe rare Japanese sexual iconography was hidden from public eye, to abide with Confucian ethics.\nKangiten has now become an important deity in Shingon.\nThe origins of the Dual Kangiten have perplexed scholars for years; there is no concrete evidence about the inception of this form.\nIt is first found in Chinese texts, related to Chinese Tantric Buddhism, which was centred on the Buddha Vairocana and propagated by the three great masters \u015aubhakarasi\u1e43ha, Vajrabodhi, and Amoghavajra.\nThe \"Dharanisamuccya\" translated to Chinese by the monk Atigupta (Atikuta) in 654 CE describes a ritual to worship the Dual Kangiten; the same ritual was replicated by Amoghavajra (705\u2013774) in his ritual text \"Daishoten Kangi Soshin Binayaka ho\".\nAmoghavajra describes Soshin Kangiten as a deva, who grants one's desires and a \"trayaka\", the protector against evil and calamity.\nIt details rituals and mantras to gain favour of the Dual Kangiten as well as the six-armed Shoten.\nIn another text by Amoghavajra, Soshin Kangiten is called a bodhisattva.\nThis text categorizes the worshippers into three: the highest can learn inner secrets, the middle can read this text and the lowest should just accompany a higher worshipper in rituals.\nIt describes rituals to gain four siddhis (\"powers\"), namely of \"protection, of gain, of love and of subjugation\".\nRituals to appease Kangiten are described to gain three material things: kingship, prosperity and sufficient food and clothing.\nThe text especially prescribes wine, the \"water of bliss\" as an offering to Kangiten.\nA minor text \"Ritual of Sho Kangiten\" (861) by Poi-jo-je Chieh-lo describes the mandalas of Kangiten.\nBodhiruci (trad.\n572\u2013727) has written two texts (dated c. 693\u2013713) that narrate about Vinayaka.\nIn one of the texts, Vinayaka teaches a host of deities and demons a one-syllable mantra, followed by a description of a ritual dedicated to the Dual Kangiten, which is also found in Amoghavajra's \"Daishoten Kangi Soshin Binayaka ho\".\nVinayaka's demon followers promise the deity to grant of wishes of beings, who repeat the one-syllable mantra.\nIn the longer version of the previous text, Bodhiruci elaborates of the Vinayaka story and enlists many rituals to propitiate the Dual Kangiten as well as the four-armed form of the deity.\nIt also has rituals to entice, gain wisdom, destroy foes etc.\nBesides the usual list of rituals, mantras and iconographical descriptions of the deity, \u015aubhakarasi\u1e43ha (early 8th century) in text, predating Amoghavajra but post-dating Atigupta composed in c. 723-36, equates Kangiten to Shiva and associates \"the Hindu king\" Vinayaka with Avalokiteshvara (Kannon).\nThe Dual Kangiten may also have been by the Hindu Tantric portrayal of Ganesha with consorts.\nNumerous Japanese Buddhist canons narrate tales about the evil nature of Vin\u0101yaka.\nThe \"Kangisoshinkuyoho\" as well as \u015aubhakarasi\u1e43ha's early Chinese text describes that King Vinayaka (Binayaka) was the son of Uma(hi) (identified with the Hindu Parvati, mother of Ganesha) and Maheshvara, the Buddhist equivalent of Shiva, father of Ganesha.\nUma produces 1500 children from her either side; from her left a host of evil Vinayakas, headed by Vinayaka (Binayaka) and from her right, benevolent virtuous hosts headed by the manifestation of Avalokiteshvara \u2013 Senanayaka (\"Lord of the army [of gods]\", identified with the Hindu god of war Skanda, the brother of Ganesha), the antithesis of Vinayaka.\nSenanayaka would take many births as the elder brother (as in the Hindu tradition) or wife of Vinayaka to defeat him.\nThen \u015aubhakarasi\u1e43ha's text says that as wife, Senanayaka embraces Vinayaka leading to the icon of the Dual Kangiten.\nIn the Japanese pantheon, Kangiten is considered as the brother of Ida-ten, identified with Skanda.\nAnother legend narrates that the king of Marakeira only ate beef and radishes.\nWhen these became rare, he started feasting on human corpses and finally living beings, turning into the great demon-king Vinayaka, who commanded an army of vinayakas.\nThe people prayed to the Avalokiteshvara, who took the form of a female vinayaka and seduced Vinayaka, filling him with joy (\"kangi\").\nThus, he, in union with her, became the Dual Kangiten.\nThe \"Kukozensho\" tells that Zaijizai, Maheshvara's consort, had a son named Shoten, who was banished from heaven, due to his evil and violent nature.\nA beautiful goddess named Gundari (Kundali), took the form of a terrible demoness and married Shoten, leading him to good ways.\nAnother tale narrates that Kangiten was the evil daughter of Mahaeshvara, driven out from heaven.\nShe took refuge at Mount Binayaka and married a fellow male-Binayaka, resulting in the Dual Kangiten icon.\nJapanese variants of the legend of the Dual Kangiten emphasize that union of Vinayaka (the male) and Vainayaki (the female) transforms an evil obstacle creator into a reformed individual.\nKangiten is considered to be endowed with great power.\nKangiten is regarded as protector of temples and worshipped generally by gamblers, actors, geishas and people in the business of \"pleasure\".\nMantras are often prescribed in ritual texts to appease the deity and even to drive away this obstacle-maker.\nRice wine (sake), radishes (daikon) and \"bliss-buns\" (kangi-dan), a deep fried confection filled with red-bean paste which is based on the modak offered to Ganesha, are offered to the god.\nWhile Kangiten is worshipped throughout Japan, H\u014dzan-ji on the summit of Mount Ikoma is his most important and active temple.\nThough the temple is believed to have been founded in the sixth century, it came in the limelight in the 17th century when the monk Tankai (1629\u20131716) made the temple's \"Gohonzon\", a Heian period, gilt-bronze image of the Dual Kangiten, the centre of attraction.\nIn the Genroku era (1688\u20131704), Osaka merchants, especially vegetable-oil sellers, joined Kangiten's cult, attributing their success to his worship.\nBusiness people still continue to worship him at the sanctuary and figurines of the Dual Kangiten are found in shops around the temple.\nThe central Dual Kangiten icon is kept under a phallic cover called the \"linga-kosa\", when not being worshipped.\nBesides Shingon worship, as of 1979, Kangiten's worship was recorded in at least 243 Japanese shrines."}

Easton & Son of Exeter, it is a total of high, with a high pedestal.\nThe figure representing Victory, tall, is said to hold \"aloft a spray of laurels in token of gratitude to Heaven.\nBoldly modelled, and with considerable action, this figure, standing on a dragon, forms an interesting silhouette from all sides.\"\nOn each of the four arms of the cross is a bronze figure representing the war, including a soldier, a sailor on the hull of a ship, a prisoner of war, and a V.A.D.\nnurse in uniform holding a bandage.\nThe figures would each be in height if they were standing.\nThe dedication ceremony for the memorial was celebrated by the Bishop of Crediton Robert Trefusis.\nIt was unveiled by the Right Honourable Admiral David Beatty.\nCeremonies were concluded by a trumpeter on Athelstan's Tower who played The Last Post.\nDuring World War II a tall brick wall was built around the memorial, leaving just the figure on top visible, to protect it against possible bomb damage.\nAfter the war additional bronze plaques were added on the base to honour the soldiers killed in that conflict.\nThe memorial is one of two civic memorials in Exeter, the other being the Devon County War Memorial by Sir Edwin Lutyens, in the form a simple cross outside Exeter Cathedral.\nThe two memorials were the responsibility of separate committees; the city and county memorial committees conspicuously failed to work together.\nAccording to Sir James Owen, chairman of the Exeter City War Memorial Committee, the city offered a joint committee but the county \"slammed the door in our face\", while Hugh Fortescue, 4th Earl Fortescue, chairman of the Devon County War Memorial Committee, accused the city of proceeding with its own project without any discussion with the county.\nIn November 2010, following the death of Harry Patch, the last English survivor of World War I trench warfare, a ceremony was held at the memorial.\nDevon historian Dr. Todd Gray noted that with his death, the time for remembrance had arrived: Now \".\n.\n.\nwe are at that point.\n.\n.\n.\nThe city's Great War memorial was created so that future generations would know about the sacrifices men made on their behalf.\nIn the years that have followed this monument and all others have evolved into memorials for all war and I would encourage any Exonian who has a few moments to show their respect.\"\nAs Dr. Gray observed, this is one of hundreds of World War I memorials scattered around Devon.\nHe believes that even though they are nearly a century old, they are relevant today, as they are community centers for sharing and grief.\nOn 10 September 2012, a new memorial to honour those from Exeter who gave their lives since World War II was dedicated.\nIt is said to be a \"complement\" to the 1923 memorial.\nThe dedication was hosted by Air Chief Marshal Sir Stuart Peach.\nThe memorial will honour ten Exeter servicemen who \"lost their lives in conflicts overseas\", including those in Afghanistan, Iraq, and Northern Ireland.\nFamily members of the soldiers were consulted as to its form.\nAttendees included the Lord Mayor Councillor Rob Newby, the Bishop of Exeter the Rt.\nRev.\nMichael Langrish, and battalion and regimental representatives from the units in which the fallen had served.\nMayor Newby stated, \"As a city, we already honour our dead from the two Great Wars, and it is fitting that we honour those who have fallen since 1945.\nThis memorial allows us to do just that.\"\nThe polished granite tablet has a remembrance exhortation and lists ten names.\nThe Exeter City Council commissioned it upon the suggestion of Kirianne Curley, widow of one of the honoured fallen.\nIt will continue to be the site of local services on Remembrance Sunday.\nLike the original dedication ceremony, this too concluded with a playing of \"The Last Post\".\nIn September 2014, Historic England designated the original memorial as a Grade II* listed building."}

1860 that centered on Pyramid Lake in what is now Nevada in the United States.\nThe war was caused by an influx of miners and ranchers after silver was discovered in the Comstock Lode near to Carson City.\nThe newcomers assaulted the Paiutes and destroyed their foods supplies.\nWhen the Paiutes responded, the U.S. Army used force to suppress them.\nBoth before and after the war, Numaga was a strong advocate of peace and did much to reduce the violence on both sides.\nHe died of tuberculosis, a \"white man's disease\", in 1871.\nThe Paiute traditionally followed a hunting and gathering lifestyle in the Great Basin region that covers most of modern-day Nevada and western Utah, extending north into Oregon and bounded on the west by the Sierra Nevada in California.\nTemperatures range from extreme heat in the summer to bitter cold in the winter.\nThe land is semi-arid, with vegetation ranging from dense coniferous forests on the mountains surrounding the basin, to thinner woodlands lower down, giving way to grasslands and then to bunch grass, sage brush and scrub on the basin floor, with barren areas of gravel or alkali flats.\nThe Paiutes had no central government, but lived in bands of around a hundred people who would occupy a territory of about .\nThe Paiute migrated with the seasons, living in temporary huts built of willow poles covered with brush and reeds.\nThey lived on shoots and roots, fruit, fish, ducks, lizards, grubs and insects.\nIn fall, pine nuts from the pi\u00f1on trees in the hills were an essential foodstuff.\nIn winter the Paiute hunted game in the lowlands, particularly rabbits.\nNumaga was born sometime around 1830.\nHe was said by some to be the son of Chief Winnemucca (also called Po-i-to) and brother of Sarah Winnemucca.\nSarah Winnemucca wrote that he was her cousin.\nAnother source says he was no relative of Poito, and the two were never friendly.\nNumaga was called \"Young Winnemucca\" by the whites, or sometimes just \"Winnemucca\".\nNumaga was at least six feet tall, a man of great physical strength with a quiet dignity which gave him an air of superiority.\nA soldier who saw him in August 1860 said, \"In appearance he is all that romance could desire, deep-chested and strong-limbed, with a watchful, earnest expression of countenance, indicative of graver thought and study [than is] common to the aboriginal race.\"\nEarly contacts between the Paiutes and white fur trappers and traders were friendly, but the Northern Paiute became more hostile after the California gold rush began in 1848 and brought large numbers of miners and immigrants into their lands.\nNumaga picked up English while working for several seasons as a field hand for the Mission Fathers in the Santa Clara Valley of California.\nThrough his evident sincerity, intellect, eloquence and courage Numaga gained considerable stature among the Paiute,\nand was viewed by the whites as their leader, although he did not have this official standing.\nIn 1859, the news broke that silver had been found in the huge Comstock Lode in Washoe, a region that was then in the western part of Utah Territory, and that would soon become the territory of Nevada.\nHordes of miners flooded to the mining center of Virginia City, near to Carson City.\nThey cut down pinyon trees to make fuel for ore-processing, destroying the pine-nut \"orchards\" that were essential to the Paiute food economy.\nHunters and trappers took big game, fish and waterfowl to feed the miners.\nRanchers moved into the fertile valleys, cutting off access to places where nuts, roots and seeds could be gathered.\nIn the late fall of 1859, two miners were killed in the mountains and were found with arrows in their bodies.\nTheir money had been stolen but not their clothing or supplies,\nmaking it questionable whether Indians were responsible since the indigenous people did not yet have a money economy.\nMajor William Ormsby asked for help in finding the culprits from Chief Winnemucca (Poito).\nHe was friendly with Poito, whose daughter Sarah and her younger sister were staying in his house to be educated in English and in reading and writing.\nTwo days later, one hundred Paiute warriors swathed in rabbit-skin clothing rode into Carson City, led by Chief Natchez and Chief Numaga.\nNatchez, son of Chief Winnemucca, was the peace-chief at that time and Numaga was the war-chief.\nNumaga agreed to help.\nHe sent five men to the camp of the Washoe leader Captain Jim to ask him to give up the guilty men, since the arrows had been made by Washoes.\nEventually, under protest, Captain Jim sent two men to stand trial in order to avoid reprisals on his people.\nThey were shot dead in Numaga's presence by a mob of angry whites.\nThe indigenous people of the region, including the Paiutes and Washoes, were threatened by starvation in the winter of 1859\u20131860.\nThere were growing numbers of fights between whites and Indians.\nThe Paiutes gathered at Pyramid Lake towards the end of April 1860 for a conference on how to deal with the encroachments of the white men.\nMost of the leaders spoke out for war.\nWinnemucca (Poito), the most senior leader at the assembly, appeared to be in favor of war but refrained from taking a public position.\nMyron Angel, in his 1881 \"History of Nevada\", said that Numaga was the only chief who spoke in favor of peace.\nFrom his experience with the whites in California, Numaga was more aware of their resources than most of his audience.\nHe agreed that the white men had greatly wronged the Indians, but pointed out that the whites would be bound to win any war.\nHe argued that a peaceful course would be wiser, letting the Indians keep their ancestral lands.\nWhile Numaga was speaking, a group of Indians arrived and brought news of an incident that had just happened at Williams Station.\nAfter hearing what had taken place, Numaga said, \"There is no longer any use for counsel; we must prepare for war, for the soldiers will now come here to fight us.\"\nThe tipping point came on 12 May 1860.\nFive employees of Williams Station, a Pony Express post on the Carson River, captured and raped two Northern Paiute women.\nA band of Northern Paiutes attacked the post, killed the men and freed the women.\nMajor William Ormsby collected a force of 105 volunteers from Virginia city who went out to bury the dead white men, and then punish the Paiutes at Pyramid Lake.\nThe Paiutes led by Numaga lured this force into a dangerous position.\nThe volunteers were poorly armed with handguns against the Indians' long-range rifles, and were outmaneuvered in what turned from a confident advance into a desperate defense.\nMost of the whites were killed, including Ormsby, in what is now known as the Battle of Pyramid Lake.\nIn all, seventy-six of Ormsby's volunteers died and most of the rest were wounded, saved only by the coming of nightfall.\nThe defeat by the despised Indians had a devastating effect on white morale.\nAn army officer arriving in the region just after the battle found a scene of chaos and some panic, with trains of people returning to California to avoid the Indians.\nVolunteers were armed and mustered to counter the danger from an estimated 15,000 well-armed and well-mounted \"Pah Utes, Shishones and Pitt River Indians.\"\nSince the Indians had assembled at Pyramid Lake there had been \"daily news of massacres by the red villains.\"\nColonel Jack Hays, a former Texas Ranger, was given command of the United States forces.\nHays mustered a force of over 750 soldiers and volunteers, who set out from California on 2 June 1860.\nHays fought the Paiutes in two skirmishes near Pyramid Lake.\nNeither was decisive, but the Indians sustained sufficient injuries to destroy Numaga's loosely coordinated command structure.\nThe bands dispersed into the Black Rock and Smoke Creek deserts and the surrounding hills.\nSome travelled further into Oregon, Idaho and Washington Territory.\nThe war petered out.\nU.S. troops built a temporary fort near Pyramid Lake, then moved to the more permanent Fort Churchill, which guarded the wagon trail from the east.\nOne man was killed in a U.S. scouting expedition around Pyramid Lake.\nThere was a minor skirmish with a group of soldiers under Frederick W. Lander, an Army engineer.\nLander was establishing watering holes and building a wagon road through the Black Rock Desert.\nTo him, the Indian hostilities were a distraction from the job at hand, and he initiated a truce with Numaga that turned into a lasting peace.\nLander's assistant commissary agent captured five Northern Paiute near the Humboldt River.\nHe released two of them in exchange for a promise that they would return with their leader, Naanah.\nLander and Neenah met on 12 August, and they agreed that Naanah would bring Numaga to a meeting at a place called Deep Hole Springs, Nevada.\nOn 21 August 1860 Numaga met with Lander at the agreed location, and after eating food prepared by Lander's men the two men smoked for a while.\nLander opened the negotiation by saying he could relay Numaga's grievances to the \"Great Father\" in Washington, but could make no promises.\nNumaga said he was pleased to hear no promises, because the whites had never kept any promises they had made in the past.\nHe said he could not guarantee being able to prevent attacks by roaming bands of Paiutes, any more than the \"Great Father\" had shown he was able to prevent whites from killing Indians.\nHe said that the violence was due to the hostile attitude of whites, who had ravaged Paiute women and killed their men without cause.\nHe disclaimed responsibility for the Williams Station incident, which he blamed on a group of Bannocks over whom he had no authority.\nHowever, he said that if the whites had come to him afterwards to discuss the problem, as had been agreed by treaty, there would have been no need for fighting.\nLander asked Numaga to try to restrain the Paiutes from hostilities for a year, and he would try to arrange a treaty under which they would retain possession of the lands they held and regain possession or be paid for lands that had been seized from them.\nNumaga accepted this.\nHe said he would try to bring Poito to meet with Frederick Dodge, the Indian agent, to arrange a formal truce.\nThe informal treaty between Numaga and Lander was effective.\nIn 1862, Winnemucca (Poito) and four hundred warriors in full regalia gave a ceremonial welcome at Pyramid Lake to James W. Nye, the first governor of the newly created Nevada Territory.\nAlthough intermittent fighting continued in later years, Numaga and Poito did not participate.\nIn 1863 Numaga came to the town of Como, near Virginia City, to issue a formal complaint against the destruction of pine-nut trees.\nHe explained that the \"pine-nut groves were the Indian's orchards\", and they depended on them for food.\nThe whites could collect fallen timber, but must not cut down the trees.\nNumaga was ignored.\nLater in the day, some unknown Indians arrived in town, causing rumors that hostiles were gathering and preparing to attack.\nWith mounting tension, two citizens met at dusk,\nIn March 1865 two white men were killed on Walker River by Indians whom they had mistreated, and later two more white men were killed in separate incidents.\nSettlers were alarmed.\nThe \"Gold Hill News\" recommended a \"final solution of the great Indian problem: by exterminating the whole race, or driving them forever beyond our frontier.\"\nA contingent of troops under a young and inexperienced leader was dispatched from Fort Churchill.\nThey heard of an encampment of cattle thieves beside Mud Lake, also called Winnemucca Lake, near to Pyramid Lake.\nBefore dawn on 14 March 1865, the contingent opened fire on the Paiute camp.\nTwenty-nine Paiutes were killed, with the troops suffering one minor injury.\nAt first, the Battle of Mud Lake was applauded in the press, although doubts were later raised about the lack of army injuries.\nIn an effort to prevent escalating violence, Governor Henry G. Blasdel requested a conference at Fort Churchill with the Paiute chiefs.\nNumaga reported what had actually happened.\nThere had been cattle thieves in the camp, but they had left before the soldiers arrived.\nApart from three or four men, there had only been women and children in the camp, including Poito's wives, who had been killed.\nSome women had jumped in the water to escape.\nThose who had not drowned had been shot.\nNumaga said the violence could easily have been avoided.\nIf the whites had asked him, he would have delivered the cattle thieves to them.\nThe Virginia City \"Daily Union\" reported on the council.\nCaptain Wells, the army leader, had said his men had killed Smoke Creek Indians in a \"stubborn and sanguinary\" fight between equal forces.\nHe had then destroyed the Indians' arms.\nHe made no mention of any women being killed.\nThere were many discrepancies between this report and the testimony of Numaga, who was highly respected by the whites.\nThe reporter questioned why Wells had destroyed the arms, which would have made valuable trophies of the battle, but said \"his command did bring in some trophies of that battle\".\nHe quoted from an article in the \"Territorial Enterprise\":\nIn the period between 1864 and 1868 there was ongoing violence between miners and settlers and the \"Snake Indians\", bands of Northern Paiutes, Bannocks and Shoshones in the Snake River and Owyhee River valleys of southern Idaho and Eastern Oregon.\nThe hostilities are sometimes called the Snake War.\nAn army expedition in May 1866 was ineffective and Indians raids, thefts and killings continued.\nAround 20 June 1866, General Henry Halleck, commander of the Military Division of the Pacific, arrived at Fort Churchill with a large entourage.\nHe was visited by many Paiutes from the Truckee and Walker River reservations.\nNumaga was the main speaker, professing friendship for the whites but presenting the Indian grievances.\nThe warriors who had accompanied Numaga put on an impressive display of horsemanship.\nNumaga said that he would take all the Indian prisoners whom Halleck had captured back to the Truckee Reservation, where he would keep watch on them.\nThe Indians received a supply of rations.\nNumaga died of tuberculosis on 5 November 1871 near Wadsworth, Nevada."}

professional footballer who plays as a defender for club Yeovil Town.\nWilkinson was born in Wells, Somerset.\nHe started his career in the youth system of Bristol City and was offered a two-year scholarship in June 2007.\nHe was part of the side that competed in the Premier Academy League.\nWilkinson was released early from his contract with Bristol City at the age of 17 and was offered a trial by Premier League club Portsmouth.\nHe played in a reserve game against Fulham, in which first-team manager Paul Hart described as the most impressive debut he had seen from any young player.\nThe reserves remained unbeaten with Wilkinson in defence until the end of the season.\nHis outstanding form for the reserves earned him a professional contract in July 2009.\nIn January 2010, he joined League Two club Northampton Town on a one-month loan, however, he failed to make an appearance for the club.\nIn February 2010, he joined Conference South club Eastleigh on an initial one-month loan, which was later extended until the end of the season.\nIn the summer of 2010, Wilkinson was released by Portsmouth and signed for newly promoted League One club Dagenham & Redbridge on a three-year contract.\nIn November 2010, he joined Conference South club Boreham Wood on an initial one-month loan, making his debut in a 3\u20132 defeat at home to Dover Athletic.\nThe loan was then extended by a further month, before it was extended once more until the end of the season.\nWilkinson scored his first goal on the final day of 2010\u201311 in a 3\u20130 win at home to Lewes and finished the season with 28 appearances.\nHe rejoined Boreham Wood in August 2011 on a five-month loan.\nHe was a mainstay in the team, making 25 appearances, the last of which came in a 2\u20131 defeat at home to Woking on 28 January 2012, before returning to Dagenham at the end of January.\nIn February 2012, he joined fellow Conference South club Dartford on loan.\nIn March 2012, his loan was extended until the end of the season after scoring two headers in consecutive wins over Havant & Waterlooville and Sutton United.\nHe claimed his first piece of silverware as Dartford were promoted to the Conference Premier via their play-off win over Welling United on 13 May 2012.\nWilkinson made his professional debut for Dagenham on 1 September 2012 in a 2\u20132 draw away to AFC Wimbledon.\nHe cemented his place in the first-team by scoring four goals, which prompted Daggers manager John Still to offer him a new contract until 2015.\nHe finished 2012\u201313 with 46 appearances in all competitions and won the club's Player of the Year award.\nThis led to reported interest from Premier League clubs Aston Villa and Norwich City.\nHowever, no move materialised and Wilkinson admitted that he needed another few years to develop as a player before making the step up.\nWilkinson's start to the 2013\u201314 season was delayed by a groin injury picked up in pre-season, before making his return at the end of August in a 3\u20130 defeat to Mansfield Town.\nHe went on to make 25 appearances but a combination of further injuries, the form of Scott Doe and Brian Saah, and the late emergence of Ian Gayle resigned Wilkinson to the bench for the majority of the season.\nIn May 2014, he was placed on the transfer list at his own request and his name was circulated to other clubs highlighting his availability.\nIn June 2014, he stated he was happy to fight for his place if a move away from the club didn't materialise.\nOn 7 July 2014, Wilkinson signed for League Two club Luton Town on a one-year contract, managed by his former Dagenham manager John Still, for an undisclosed fee.\nHe debuted on the opening day of 2014\u201315 in a 1\u20130 win away to Carlisle United, Luton's first Football League match in five years.\nWilkinson scored his first goal in a 2\u20130 win at home to Oxford United on 27 September 2014, and this was followed up with a goal in the following match, a 2\u20131 win away to Stevenage.\nHe was named League Two Player of the Month for September 2014, during which Luton kept a clean sheet in each of the four matches Wilkinson played in that month.\nWilkinson was sent off on two occasions, the first coming in stoppage time during a 1\u20130 defeat away to Burton Albion on 22 November, a result that ended Luton's 11-match unbeaten run in League Two, and the second coming in a 1\u20130 win at home to Carlisle United on 14 February 2015.\nThe latter red card coincided with a four match suspension for defensive partner Steve McNulty, who was sent off for a studs-up challenge in the previous match, a 2\u20132 draw at home to York City.\nIn their absence, Luton lost twice in a row, during which stand-in defenders Alex Lacey and Fraser Franks failed to impress.\nWilkinson finished the season with four goals from 48 appearances, triggering a one-year contract extension to keep him at Luton until the summer of 2016.\nWilkinson made his first appearance of 2015\u201316 in the starting lineup away to Accrington Stanley on the opening day of the season, which finished as a 1\u20131 draw, and followed up with a goal in the following league match, a 2\u20132 draw at home to Oxford United on 15 August 2015.\nHe went on to score two goals in September, the first coming in a 3\u20131 win away to Cambridge United on 5 September, and the second coming in a 3\u20131 win away to Morecambe on 29 September.\nWilkinson made his final appearance for Luton in a 4\u20133 defeat at home to Northampton Town on 12 December.\nOn 22 January 2016, Wilkinson was sold to fellow League Two club Stevenage on a contract until the end of 2015\u201316, with Luton replacing him with Alan Sheehan, who was signed on loan from Bradford City later that day.\nWilkinson said he was surprised by the decision but was looking forward to helping Stevenage climb the table.\nHe debuted a day later in a 0\u20130 draw at home to Barnet.\nWilkinson scored his first two goals for Stevenage in a 3\u20132 defeat at home to League Two leaders Northampton Town on 19 March.\nHe finished the season with 19 appearances for Stevenage and signed a new undisclosed length contract with the club after the end of the season.\nWilkinson was released by Stevenage at the end of the 2018\u201319 season.\nFollowing his release

Cuevas, is a companion work to her autobiography; each of the ten songs shares a title with a chapter of her book.\nThe book was a success making number 11 on \"the New York Times\" bestseller list.\nAbraham recorded her vocals for the album to a click track, while the production of the music was handled separately.\nIn an interview with \"The Fader\", Cuevas stated: \"Like, she'd heard it before and approved it for that song, but as she was recording we never had the music on.\"\nAbraham also wanted the Auto-Tune effects on her vocals to sound \"edgy\", so worked with Cuevas to make them more aggressive.\nThe album's first single, \"Finally Getting Up from Rock Bottom\", was released on August 3, 2012, through \"In Touch Weekly\" magazine.\nThe accompanying album received an overwhelmingly negative response.\nIt has been widely criticized for its extensively autotuned vocals and bland production.\nHer single \"On My Own\" was derided as one of the worst works of pop music ever made, eclipsing Rebecca Black's \"Friday\".\nFeminist website Jezebel called the lead and sole single, \"Finally Getting up from Rock Bottom\", \"the most horrible combination of sounds to ever be assembled in the history of audio recording,\" suggesting that while Farrah may have kept her baby, the song should have been aborted.\nBut despite garnering mockery in the popular media, the arrhythmic and cheaply digitized presentation of deeply confessional lyrics was bewildering enough to lead some to instead view it as a contemporary example of outsider art.\nIn \"The Wire\", Andrew Nosnitsky called it a \"haunting and fascinating mess of outsider pop music\".\nWriting for \"The Atlantic\", David Cooper Moore suggested that the album \"is to teen angst what \"Eraserhead\" was to domestic angst\", making it \"a dark and compelling experiment in abstracting and compressing the vicissitudes of 'high school drama.'\"\n\"The Village Voice\" compared it to critically acclaimed witch house band Salem.\n\"The Guardian\"s David Renshaw considered it the weirdest record of the year, describing its sound as \"an agonising, disconcerting clatter\" and \"as if someone is translating chart music into an alien language and back again.\"\nDiscussing the album's positive reception among avant garde circles, Renshaw concluded: \"All in all, it's as if Joey Essex had ditched Towie to record an album with Autechre and Lars von Trier.\"\nThe publication later ranked it 32 on their list of best albums of the year.\nIn a 2017 review for Charli XCX's \"Pop 2\" mixtape, Meaghan Garvey of \"Pitchfork\" retrospectively summarized: \"Sweepingly ridiculed as one of 2012's worst albums, that judgment, five years later, feels wildly narrow-minded.\nIt is a baffling work, to be sure: frantic layers of dubstep, EDM, witch-house, and breakbeats seem to run in the opposite direction as Abraham's absurdly AutoTuned narratives about surviving the death of her husband.\n[...] After my first full spin of \"Pop 2\", I couldn't shake the thought: 'This sounds like Farrah, but good.'\"\nIn late 2017, Duncan Cooper of \"The Fader\" wrote that \"Farrah Abraham\u2019s pop music should make her an avant-garde icon.\""}

Th\u1ea3o (1906, Tien Tinh - 1951) was a Lieutenant-general in the Viet Minh.\nHe was imprisoned by the French on the island of Poulo Condore in the early 1920s.\nHe was sent by Ho Chi Minh in 1945 to establish a resistance to French rule in Cochinchina where he established his base of operations in the Plain of Reeds near Saigon.\nA former member of the Vi\u1ec7t Nam Qu\u1ed1c D\u00e2n \u0110\u1ea3ng, he joined the Indochinese Communist Party in 1946.\nAccording to Vietnamese historian Christopher Goscha, Nguy\u1ec5n B\u00ecnh was born in Hai Hung province in northern Vietnam, Nguy\u1ec5n B\u00ecnh came from a poor family.\nAfter finishing his primary schooling, he moved to Haiphong and then made his way to Cochinchina where he worked as a laundry boy and frequented the docks of Saigon.\nHe also became increasingly involved in nationalist politics.\nIt was during this time that he befriended an influential intellectual and journalist, Tran Huy Lieu, who introduced him into the Vietnamese Nationalist Party (Viet Nam Quoc Dan Dang, VNQDD) in 1928.\nIn 1930, the French sentenced Nguy\u1ec5n B\u00ecnh to hard labor in Poulo Condor for his political activities.\nHowever, while Tran Huy Lieu crossed over to the Indochinese Communist Party (ICP) while doing hard time, Nguy\u1ec5n B\u00ecnh did not.\nHe left the island on 12 October 1934, and the nature of his activities during the rest of the 1930s remains a mystery.\nDuring World War II, he reappeared in Hai-phong, organizing anti-Japanese and then anti-French activities in cooperation with communists working in the Red River Delta, including his long time friend Tran Huy Lieu.\nFollowing the Japanese overthrow of the French, Nguy\u1ec5n B\u00ecnh began organizing his own local armed forces in the coastal areas of northeastern Vietnam, in what was known as the Tran Hung Dao war zone.\nWith the emergence of the DRV in September 1945, Ho Chi Minh and other communist leaders were impressed by Nguy\u1ec5n B\u00ecnh\u2019s initiative in these areas.\nThey brought him into the government and turned this independent-minded nationalist into their military commander-in-chief for a southern Vietnam already at war.\nNguy\u1ec5n B\u00ecnh arrived in the south in November 1945 and began unifying bandit groups, sects, and religious forces as best he could into an organized armed force to fight the French forces of General Philippe Leclerc.\nIn December 1945, Nguy\u1ec5n B\u00ecnh became chief of war Zone VII (Bo Tu Lenh Khu VII) in eastern Nam Bo, including the colonial city of Saigon-Cholon.\nWhen all the best French forces transferred to the north in March 1946, he was able to strengthen his guerrilla activities considerably in the south.\nIn June 1946, Nguy\u1ec5n B\u00ecnh joined the ICP.\nLater that year, he urged Hanoi-based leaders to forget about negotiating with the French and to prepare instead for full-scale war, including the leveling of Hanoi.\nIndeed, he ran an angry urban war against the French and their Vietnamese allies in the streets and back alleys of Saigon-Cholon throughout the rest of the 1940s.\nOn several occasions, Nguy\u1ec5n B\u00ecnh made his way secretly into Saigon to organize sabotage and assassination squads.\nIn early 1947, as the French began to break off the Cao Dai and Hoa Hao from Nguy\u1ec5n B\u00ecnh\u2019s united front, he took a hard line towards the defecting religious leaders.\nThe result was civil war between Nguy\u1ec5n B\u00ecnh\u2019s army and the forces of the Hoa Hao and Cao Dai, leading to the Viet Minh\u2019s assassination of Huynh Phu So.\nIn 1948, the leader of the Binh Xuyen, Le Van Vien, broke with Nguy\u1ec5n B\u00ecnh and defected to the French side.\nIn January 1948, Nguy\u1ec5n B\u00ecnh was named major general in the DRV army, second only to General Vo Nguyen Giap.\nIn 1949, as the Vietnamese prepared for the \u201cgeneral counter-offensive\u201d, Ho Chi Minh named him commander of the armed forces in the south.\nNguy\u1ec5n B\u00ecnh began building in earnest a modern army, organized in battalions and briefly as regiments.\nIn 1949 and 1950, apparently on orders from the north, he launched head-on attacks against French posts across southern Vietnam.\nThanks to superior artillery and air power, the French handed him one of his worst setbacks in his life while powerful communists began to criticize his tactics.\nNonetheless, Nguy\u1ec5n B\u00ecnh had demonstrated that not only could southerners fight an urban war, but they could also move towards creating a modern army as in the north, and this without a Chinese rear-guard and large-scale foreign aid.\nB\u00ecnh was described by one French journalist as \"cruel, indefatigable, pitless, authoritarian.\"\nHe nevertheless became a hero to some in the revolutionary movement, and an enemy to many in the H\u00f2a H\u1ea3o, Cao \u0110\u00e0i, and other organizations that eventually opposed the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.\nIn late 1951, following important changes occurring at the international level and within the ICP, the DRV summoned Nguy\u1ec5n B\u00ecnh to the north for further training and consultations in preparation for the wider war against the French, including the creation of a trans-Indochinese supply trail running from the north to the south.\nWhile crossing through northeastern Cambodia, Nguyen Binh perished in an ambush in September 1951 laid by the 4th Bataillon de chasseurs cambodgiens under Jacques Hogard.\nGeneral Nguyen Binh\u2019s remains were returned to Vietnam from Cambodia in 2000."}

There\u2019s never a sky not worthy of a few adjectives.\"\nAnd Theo Tait of the \"London Review of Books\" argued that the book \"labours under the weight of a massive Hemingway crush ... a trainwreck, from the first inept and imprecise simile, to the tin-eared rhythms, to the final incoherent thought.\"\nThe book has been adapted on screen in 2017, \"The Yellow Birds\" was directed by Alexandre Moors and starred Jack Huston, Alden Ehrenreich, Tye Sheridan and Jennifer Aniston."}

{"id": "36956192", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36956192", "title": "Electronic Communications Convention", "text": "Electronic Communications Convention\nThe United Nations Convention on the Use of Electronic Communications in International Contracts (the \"Electronic Communications Convention\", or ECC) is a treaty that aims at facilitating the use of electronic communications in international trade.\nIt was prepared by the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL) and adopted by the United Nations General Assembly on 23 November 2005.\nPursuant to Article 23, it entered into force on 1 March 2013, the first day of the month after six months passed following adoption by three States parties, namely the Dominican Republic, Honduras, and Singapore.\nThe following states have ratified, accepted, approved, acceded to, or succeeded to the Electronic Communications Convention:\nThe Electronic Communications Convention has been signed, but not yet ratified, by the Central African Republic, China, Colombia, Iran, Lebanon, Madagascar, Panama, the Philippines, the Republic of Korea, Saudi Arabia, Senegal, and Sierra Leone.\nOther states that have publicly declared their intention of adopting the Electronic Communications Convention include Australia, Bahrain, Benin, Mauritius, and Thailand.\nCanada has prepared uniform legislation to facilitate the adoption of the ECC at the State level, which has been enacted by Ontario and Saskatchewan.\nSimilar legislation has been prepared in the United States and on 10 February 2016 President Obama sent a message to the Senate asking for accession of the Convention.\nIn Australia all states and territories and the Federal parliament have passed amending legislation to conform to the Convention.\nUNCITRAL has been active in formulating uniform legislative standards for the use of electronic communications in trade since the 1980s.\nA first result of such work was the adoption of the UNCITRAL Model Law on Electronic Commerce, 1996 (MLEC), followed by the UNCITRAL Model Law on Electronic Signatures (MLES), 2001.\nHowever, a number of issues remained unsolved, namely, the possibility to enable to use of electronic communications in cases where a formal written requirement is mandated by another treaty, usually drafted before the widespread use of electronic means.\nMoreover, as model laws may be enacted with variations in the various jurisdictions, it was felt that establishing a core of common provisions would increase uniformity and therefore predictability in international trade law.\nFinally, it was felt that some of the provisions of the MLEC and of the MLES could be outdated and complemented.\nAs a result, the Electronic Communications Convention addresses different policy goals:\n1) it removes obstacles arising from formal requirements contained in other international trade law treaties;\n2) it provides a common substantive core to the law of electronic communications, thus ensuring a higher level of uniformity both in the legislative text and in its interpretation;\n3) it updates and complements the provisions of the MLEC and of the MLES;\n4) it provides core legislation on electronic communications to those States not having yet any, or having partial and insufficient provisions.\nArticle 14.5.1 of the Trans-Pacific Partnership sets forth that: \"Each Party shall maintain a legal framework governing electronic transactions consistent with the principles of the UNCITRAL Model Law on Electronic Commerce 1996 or the United Nations Convention on the Use of Electronic Communications in International Contracts, done at New York November 23, 2005\".\nWith respect to substantive provisions, the Electronic Communications Convention builds extensively, on the fundamental principles of the uniform law of electronic commerce developed by UNCITRAL (non-discrimination, technological neutrality, functional equivalence, and irrelevance of place of origin) as well as on several specific articles of the MLEC and of the MLES.\nThe Electronic Communications Convention is also inspired by a number of provisions of the CISG, especially in the parts relating to scope of application, to general principles and to final clauses.\nThus, article 3 ECC corresponds to article 6 CISG, giving effect to the principle of party autonomy.\nArticle 5 ECC is the equivalent of article 7 CISG, introducing a duty of uniform interpretation of the treaty, and defining the ancillary criteria for interpretation.\nArticle 6 builds on the notion of \"place of business\" introduced by the CISG and adapts it to the electronic environment.\nIn particular, it is specified that the location of equipment and technology supporting an information system, or the location where the information system may be accessed by other parties, are not, as such, decisive to determine the place of business.\nThose elements may, however, concur to determine the place of business.\nSimilar considerations apply to the use of a domain name or electronic mail address connected to a specific country.\nThe sources of paras.\n2 and 3 of article 6 ECC are found in article 15(4)(a) and (b) MLEC.\nArticle 1 ECC defines the scope of application of the Convention.\nThe source of inspiration of that article is clearly article 1 of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods (CISG).\nHowever, a major difference lies in the fact that the ECC, unlike the CISG, does not require that the concerned parties have their places of business in States parties to the ECC.\nTherefore, the ECC applies if the law applicable to the communications is the law of a State party to the ECC, or if the parties have validly chosen as the law applicable to their communications the law of a State party to the ECC.\nA third option is the application of the substantive provisions of the ECC if chosen by virtue of agreement of the parties.\nAccording to art.\n4(a) ECC \u201cCommunication\u201d means any statement, declaration, demand, notice or request, including an offer and the acceptance of an offer, that the parties are required to make or choose to make in connection with the formation or performance of a contract; it is therefore not necessary that the contract is concluded.\nMoreover, it is possible that only some or one clause of the contract are in electronic form, including, for instance, the arbitration clause.\nMoreover, according to art.\n4(b) ECC \u201cElectronic communication\u201d means any communication that the parties make by means of data messages; the notion of data message is defined in art.\n4 (c) ECC along the lines of the same definition contained in the MLEC and MLES.\nThe outcome of such broad approach is that the notion of electronic communication encompasses the use of different technologies, including, e.g., SMS, but also digital audio and video recording.\nArt.\n2(1)(a) ECC is inspired by article 2(a) CISG.\nBoth provisions aim at excluding consumers' transactions from the scope of application of the respective conventions.\nArt.\n2(1)(b) ECC excludes from the scope of application of the convention certain fields that already enjoy uniform legal provisions, contractually (e.g., international payments systems) or otherwise (e.g., treaties relating to securities held with an intermediary).\nArt.\n2(2) ECC excludes from the scope of application of the convention electronic transferable records.\nThese are electronic records that entitle the entity controlling them to the delivery of goods or the payment of a sum, as evidenced in the record.\nThis exclusion is due to the fact that uniform legal standards for the functional equivalence of notions such as \u201cpossession\u201d in the electronic world have yet to be developed.\nSince 2011, UNCITRAL Working Group IV (Electronic Commerce) is tasked with defining those standards.\nStates may vary the scope of application of the Convention by lodging declarations.\nThus, the declaration foreseen in article 19(1)(a) limits the application of the Convention to cases when all the States where the parties involved in the transaction have their place of business are contracting States.\nThis is the same mechanism envisaged in article 1(1)(a) CISG.\nArticle 19(1)(b) limits the application of the Convention to cases when the parties so choose.\nArticle 19(2) ECC gives States the possibility to exclude certain matters from the scope of application of the ECC.\nThese exceptions could be similar to those made in corresponding national legislation: Singapore has lodged this type of declaration upon ratification of the Electronic Communications Convention.\nLast, but not least, parties may vary or derogate from any provision of the Convention under its article 3.\nThis is a provision common in international trade law treaties, where freedom of contract is considered an overarching principle.\nHowever, in practice there might be limits of public order, or other mandatory provisions, that might limit the freedom of the parties.\nArticle 8 ECC sets forth at the international level the principle of non-discrimination of electronic communications already established, for national legislation, in article 5 MLEC.\nArticle 9 ECC is the core provision establishing the parameters for functional equivalence between electronic and paper-based communications.\nIn particular, article 9(2) ECC deals with functional equivalence of the notion of \"written form\".\nThe provision follows that of article 6(1) MLEC.\nArticle 9(3) ECC deals with functional equivalence for \"signature\".\nIn practice, this provision enables cross-border recognition of all types of electronic signatures.\nTo do so, art.\n9(3) ECC departs from both UNCITRAL relevant precedents, i.e.\narticle 7(1) MLEC and article 12 MLES.\nTwo major innovations were introduced with respect to article 7(1) MLEC: a) the notion of \"person's approval\" was substituted with that of \"party's intention\" in order to better capture the various functions associated with signatures, which go well beyond mere approval; and b) a safety clause was introduced in article 9(3)(b)(ii) ECC to ensure that electronic signatures that provide for a method to identify the party and to indicate the party's intention, and that have indeed fulfilled that function by themselves or together with other evidence, may not be repudiated.\nIn other words, if it is possible to identify the signatory of an electronic communication, that signatory may not challenge the signature on the basis of the signature's method or nature.\nArticle 9(4) and (5) ECC provides for the functional equivalent of original, along the lines of article 8(1) and (3) MLEC.\nArticle 10 ECC deals with time and place of dispatch and receipt of electronic communications.\nIts predecessor is article 15 MLEC.\nArticle 10(1) ECC innovates on article 15(1) MLEC: in the ECC, the electronic communication is dispatched when it leaves the system under the control of the originator, while in the MLEC it (or, better, the data message in the terminology of that Model Law) has to enter a system outside the control of the originator: the rule has been changed in order to avoid consequences for the originator when the message may not enter the information system for reasons not under control of the originator (e.g., firewall; filter; system down...).\nArticle 10(2) ECC follows article 15(2) MLEC in introducing the difference between designated and non-designated electronic address for determining the time of receipt of an electronic communication.\nArticle 10(2) ECC contains a novel element by requiring that the recipient should be aware that the communication was sent (and the communication is capable of being retrieved), while the provision of the MLEC requires actual retrieval by the addressee, which might again expose the originator to liability for circumstances under the addressee's control.\nArticle 10(3) ECC corresponds to article 15(4) MLEC.\nThis provision must be read in conjunction with article 6 ECC, as must be article 10(4) ECC.\nThe Electronic Communications Convention contains, in its Chapter IV, rather elaborate final clauses.\nFinal clauses aimed at modifying the scope of application of the Convention are discussed above.\nArticle 17 ECC sets forth the applicable rules for those cases where electronic communications fall under the legislative authority of a regional economic integration organisation (REIO).\nThe rationale of article 17 is, on the one hand, to ensure that the Convention will not be applied to commercial relations falling under the scope of application of the legislation of the REIO and, on the other hand, to clarify the distribution of legislative power between REIOs (and therefore unaffected by the Convention) and national States (and therefore under the scope of the Convention in case of cross-border exchanges).\nIn other words, the Convention does not intend to interfere with regional regimes.\nIn particular, article 17(2) ECC requires the REIO that intends to become a party to the ECC to deposit a declaration on the distribution of competences between the REIO and its member States.\nThe REIO member States are supposed to do the same.\nArticle 17(4) contains the \"disconnection clause\" that should ensure that REIOs' legal regimes are unaffected by the operation of the Electronic Communications Convention.\nThe matter has important practical consequences.\nIn fact, the absence of an agreed declaration on the distribution of competences between the European Union and its member States has prevented those States from signing or becoming a party to the Electronic Communications Convention: among the 20 States that are signatory or party to the Convention, none is an EU member State.\nOne major goal of the Electronic Communications Convention is the removal of obstacles to international trade arising from the insertion of formal requirements in treaties concluded before the broad adoption of electronic means.\nArticle 20 ECC lists several treaties prepared by UNCITRAL as treaties that will be \"electrified\" by the adoption of the ECC.\nIn other words, by virtue of adoption of the ECC formal requirements contained in those treaties, especially written form requirements, will be satisfied with the use of electronic communications under the conditions set forth in the ECC.\nSome UNCITRAL treaties are excluded from the list in article 20, in particular, the United Nations Convention on the Carriage of Goods by Sea, 1978 (the \"Hamburg Rules\") and the United Nations Convention on International Bills of Exchange and International Promissory Notes, 1988.\nThe reason for the exclusion is that those two treaties contain provisions on negotiable documents, which are excluded from the scope of the ECC (art.\n2(2)).\nThe United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Carriage of Goods Wholly or Partly by Sea, 2008 (the \"Rotterdam Rules\"), which was also prepared by UNCITRAL and contains provisions on electronic transferable records, was concluded after the ECC.\nArticle 20(2) ECC indicates that the Convention will apply also to all other treaties where the exchange of electronic communications is relevant, unless a State declares not to be bound by this provision.\nEven if this \"opt out\" declaration is made, the declaring State may still choose, under article 20(3) ECC, certain treaties to which the ECC will apply.\nArticle 20(4) ECC gives the possibility of a State to prevent the interaction of the ECC with a given treaty even if the State has not lodged any other declaration regarding the Convention's scope of application.\nIn other words, under article 20(3) ECC the State makes a general opt out and a selective opt in, while under article 20(4) the State makes a general opt in, and a selective opt out.\nThe UNCITRAL law library bibliography\nUnited

140 appearances the club before transferring to Accrington Stanley.\nWhile at Stanley, he impressed in an FA Cup match against Crewe Alexandra who signed him in 1991.\nHowever, in his three years at

manager for the interim.\nClark missed out on getting the role full-time as it was given to Gerry Luczka instead, however he was later awarded the Players' Player of the Year award for the second

friendly at Nelson.\nIn October 2008 Clark suffered a knee injury that saw him sidelined for the longest period in his career, only recovering from the injury after an operation in February 2009.\nOnly a year later in February 2010 after making over 150 appearances for the club, Clark called time on his career after having never fully recovered from the injury that sidelined him the

Jacobus divides the possibilities into three basic views of God\u2019s physical relationship with the environment.\nOne, the Creator-God exists externally to the physical world (Timm, 1994).\nThe second is God exists internally in the environment (McFague, 1993, Tobias, 1994).\nThe third basic view stipulates God as an entity does not exist (Berry, 1994; Callicott, 1994; Swimme, 1994; Wei-ming, 1994).\nThree variations of these basic types can be identified in literature.\nThe first is the person of God can be distinctly separate from the environment and also exist internally in the environment (White, 1994).\nA second variation purports that God and nature exist as separate deities (Griffin, 1994).\nThe third variation denies God as a cognitive entity and views the environment as Creator/deity.\nIf God is external to the environment God then the Creator-God interfaces with the environment as a distinct entity, while if God is internal to the environment, one may make no distinction between the person of God and the environment and the notion of Creator itself may become problematic.\nA mystical viewpoint common to several religious traditions that unites these categories is that God is continuously creating the universe, and that the universe is a direct expression of God's being, rather than an object created by God as the subject.\nFrom the environmental perspective the corresponding worldviews would be (1) nature is created, (2) nature is divine and (3) nature is emergent.\nThree environmental theologies emerge, (1) God exists eternally and the environment is God\u2019s creation, (2) the environment is God (Nelson, 1990) and (3) the environment emerged from physical conditions (Fraley, 2000).\nBut Robert S. Corrington goes so far as to say that God is an emergent property of the cosmos itself.\nThere is not a clear distinction between environmental theology and ecotheology, though the term environmental theology might indicate a theology in which environmental ethics is established prior to one's understanding of the meaning of God."}

{"id": "36956801", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36956801", "title": "Sechin Bajo", "text": "Sechin Bajo\nSechin Bajo is a large archaeological site with ruins dating from 3500 BCE to 1300 BCE, making it one of the oldest centers of civilization in the Western Hemisphere.\nSechin Bajo is located in the valley of the Sechin River, about from the Pacific Ocean and about northwest of Lima, Peru.\nSechin Bajo is one ruin among many located in close proximity to each other in the valleys of the Casma and Sechin Rivers.\nIn 2008, a German and Peruvian archaeological team, headed by Peter Fuchs, announced that a circular plaza, in diameter and constructed of rocks and rectangular adobe bricks had been found at Sechin Bajo.\nRadiocarbon dating indicated that plaza was constructed in 3500 BCE.\nA nearby 2 meter-tall (2 yards) frieze was dated at 3600 BCE.\nThe plaza and the frieze are the two oldest examples of monumental architecture discovered thus far in the Americas.\nSechin Bajo may contend with sites of Norte Chico as the oldest urban settlement of the Americas.\nThe Peruvian Pacific coast is one of the driest deserts in the world with average annual precipitation of less than .\nAlong the of Peruvian coast, 57 small rivers flow into the sea, watered by the higher precipitation received in the Andes Mountains inland at elevations higher than .\nEach river valley forms a linear oasis in which irrigated agriculture is possible.\nThe valleys of the Casma River and its tributary, the Sechin River, are one of the linear oases.\nThe ancient area of the Casma/Sechin culture extends about inland from the sea.\nThe width of the irrigable valleys range from .\nLocated along about in the Sechin River valley, just upstream from its junction with the Casma, is a complex of archaeological ruins that includes sites such as Sechin Bajo, Sechin Alto, Cerro Sechin, and Taukachi-Konkan, all of them except Sechin Alto in the desert just beyond the edge of the irrigated river valley.\nThe Casma valley was populated long before the monumental construction began.\nThe oldest radio carbon date found at Sechin Bajo is 4500 BCE although other signs of human occupation of the Casma valley date back to before 6,000 BCE.\nSechin Bajo is located about north of the Norte Chico civilization, believed to be the oldest in the Americas.\nGiven the short distances contact and transmission of cultural traits between the two areas was likely.\nThe ruins of Sechin Bajo cover an area of about .\nThe ceremonial center of the ruin consists of three monumental constructions dating from different times.\nThe \"First Edifice\" or \"First Building\" is the oldest, initially consisting of a platform square built of rocks and adobe brick and raised 2 meters over sunken circular plazas.\nThe sunken circular plaza feature was maintained throughout.\nIn one iteration, calibrated radiocarbon dating of the First Building ranges from as early as 3700 BCE and as late as 2900 BCE during the pre-ceramic (prior to the use of pottery) period of Peruvian archaeology.\nThe First Building was reconstructed on five occasions during that time period with plazas and staircases being constructed, filled in, and reconstructed on multiple occasions.\nThe oldest of the sunken plazas was radio carbon dated at 3500 BCE in 2008.\nAn adobe frieze was dated at 3600 BCE.\nThe frieze, tall, is of a man holding something in one hand and something else in the other.\nWhat he is holding has been interpreted as a ritual knife or a ceremonial cane in one hand and a human head or a shield in the other hand.\nThe \"Second Building\" and the \"Third Building\" were constructed much later, on top of the First Building and to cover a much larger area.\nThey date from approximately 1600 BCE to 1200 BCE.\nThe Third Building is the most monumental with both public squares and private areas and with many walls decorated with relief carvings.\nAfter the three buildings on the site were abandoned, they were used as a graveyard up until the fifteenth century CE.\nThe construction of the Second and Third Buildings was oriented toward Cerro Sechin, distant on the other side of the Sechin Valley.\nThat indicates cooperation (or subordination) among the builders of the two sites.\nThe husband and wife archaeological team of the Pozorskis have speculated that Sechin Bajo and other Casma/Sechin cities and ceremonial centers were conquered about 1000 BCE by invaders from the highlands.\nThe purported invaders introduced maize, domesticated animals, warlike carvings, and different styles of ceramics and architecture.\nThe oldest radiocarbon dates (3600 BCE) of Sechin Bajo, if confirmed by additional investigations, may establish it as oldest site of monumental construction yet found in the Americas.\nThis may mean that Sechin Bajo in the Casma and Sechin valleys may claim to be the oldest urban site in the Americas.\nThat distinction in the early 21st century is held by the Norte Chico civilization of which the oldest ruins are dated at about 3500 BCE at Huaricanga, south of Sechin Bajo.\nAnother relevant ancient site is Bandurria, Peru in the River Huaura valley, with radio-carbon dates of 3200 BC.\nOther important findings include confirmation that the Casma and Sechin valleys were probably occupied c.4500 BCE by a stable and sedentary or semi-sedentary population which eventually produced the monumental architecture found at Sechin Bajo.\nThe date at which agriculture became the most important source of subsistence of the people of the valleys is uncertain.\nThe findings at Sechin Bajo appear to contradict the theory of anthropologist Michael E. Moseley and others that the earliest civilizations in Peru were based not on agriculture, but on exploitation of the rich maritime resources of the Peruvian coastline at sites such as Las Haldas which practiced little or no agriculture.\nThe oldest radiocarbon dates for Las Haldas, about from Sechin Bajo, are about 2400 BCE."}

is a British comedy and late night television talk show that originally ran alongside the 2012 Summer Paralympics every night following the main coverage on Channel 4.\nHosted by Australian comedian Adam Hills and co-hosted by Josh Widdicombe and Alex Brooker, it gives a review of the day's events.\nFeaturing a mix of comedy, guests and Paralympics highlights, the show received strong reviews and regularly pulled in more than a million viewers each night of the Paralympic Games.\nIt has since become a weekly show giving a humorous alternative look back at the week's events.\nSeries 18 is scheduled to begin airing on Friday 25 October 2019.\n\"The Last Leg\" is described by main presenter Adam Hills as \"Three guys with four legs talking about the week\", because Hills was born without a right foot and Brooker had his right leg amputated when he was a baby.\nThe original series, broadcast during the 2012 Paralympics, was a look back at each day's events during the competition, as well as a look at the news that week.\nFollowing on from the Paralympics, the series became weekly, and looks at the events in the news that week, as well as covering Paralympic matters.\nThe show features guest interviews with Paralympians and celebrities.\nThe series is broadcast live and encourages interaction with the viewers at home, holding polls via Twitter using hashtags.\nA recurring theme in the show is the use of the hashtag #isitok to highlight questions from Twitter users to be asked in the show.\nInitially it was for asking questions about disability that people felt awkward asking; the broadening of the show's remit is reflected in the questions asked in this stream.\nThe show originally was broadcast from the Riverside Studios in London.\nIt would later move to the ITV London Studios on London's south bank.\nFrom Series 14 it is now made in Studio TC1 at the BBC Studios in Television Centre, West London, which is operated and run by BBC Studioworks.\nRecurring segments in the show include rants or attacks by Hills on certain people and organisations, which has since resulted in the coining of Hills' catchphrase: \"Don't be a dick!\"\nAnother segment is \"The Last 7 Days\", in which Widdicombe looks at more comic news items that have occurred during the week, and Brooker's various attempts to qualify for the 2016 Summer Paralympics.\nAnother is the \"Bullshit Button\", which was first used in a segment in which Brooker interviewed the then-Leader of the Liberal Democrats Nick Clegg to see if Clegg could persuade him to vote in the 2015 UK general election.\nBrooker would press a large red buzzer that played an audio recording of him saying the word \"Bullshit\" if he thought Clegg was lying during the interviews.\nSince then, the buzzer has been used in various situations whenever the show thinks someone is lying, and a second buzzer has been added which features Widdicombe saying: \"That's true, actually\" when someone says something that really is true.\nAfter appearing on the show in 2017, comedian Armando Iannucci's voice has replaced Brooker's voice on the bullshit button.\nSince the replacement, four more buttons have been implemented, all four varying in levels: \"cow chutney\", \"a shite in shining armour\", \"a turd the size of Disneyland Paris\" and \"Thomas the Wank Engine\", the latter being the most often used.\nSince January 2014, \"The Last Leg\" has presented a mock prize to the \"Dick of the Year\", awarded for being the biggest dick over the previous year.\nThe winner is voted on by the viewers using Twitter with the hashtag #dickoftheyear.\nThe winner for 2013 was Russian president Vladimir Putin.\nIn January 2015, journalist Katie Hopkins received the most votes for 2014's \"Dick of the Year\" but Hills and the team making the show made an executive decision to not give Hopkins the prize on the grounds that she would enjoy receiving it.\nThus, the prize went to the person with the second-highest number of votes, UK Independence Party leader Nigel Farage.\nThe prize for 2015 was awarded to Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt, who won 80% of the vote in the final round of voting, beating Donald Trump into second place.\nIn the 2016 Christmas special, the prize was awarded to whole of the year 2016, defeating Donald Trump, Nigel Farage and David Cameron.\nIn 2017, it was announced that as well as \"Dick of the Year\", the people who have come second and third will be named \"Ballbags of the Year\".\nThe nominations for 2017 were decided for by both public vote and a selection of wildcards chosen by the hosts of the show.\nThe nominees are Theresa May, Kim Jong-un, Donald Trump, Adam's wildcard Bob Katter, Josh's wildcard Lewis Hamilton, and Alex's wildcard Philip Hammond.\nThe result was Trump being declared the winner, with May second and Hamilton third.\nThere was also a special award given to Harvey Weinstein, who has ruled out of running for the main award on the grounds that it is possible that Weinstein may take \"Dick of the Year\" as a compliment.\nWeinstein was given the \"Steaming Turd\" award for \"lifetime achievement\".\n2018 followed a similar format to the previous year, with nominees selected by viewers and three from the hosts.\nThe nominees were Theresa May, Jacob Rees-Mogg, Piers Morgan, Adam's wildcard Boris Johnson, Josh's wildcard Steve Smith, and Alex's wildcard Thanos.\nRees-Mogg was announced as the winner, whilst Donald Trump was given a special award.\nThe theme music is an instrumental version of Public Enemy's \"Harder Than You Think\", which became the show's permanent theme after initially serving as the title music to the whole of Channel 4's 2012 Paralympic Games coverage.\nThe first and ninth series were broadcast daily at the end of the day's Paralympics coverage on Channel 4.\nThe second series was broadcast each Friday, with the show moving to Wednesday nights for its third series, before reverting to Friday nights for the fourth and fifth series.\nIn October 2012 it was announced that the show would return for a Christmas special titled \"The Last Leg of the Year\" and a second series, which began broadcasting in January 2013.\nA third and fourth series followed in July 2013 and January 2014 (timed around the 2014 Winter Paralympics) respectively.\nA fifth series started broadcasting in August 2014, followed by a sixth series in January 2015 and a seventh in June 2015.\nAfter the seventh series, a special 2-part series entitled \"The Last Leg Goes Down Under\" was broadcast on 29 January and 5 February 2016, and preceded the start of series 8 on 12 February.\nStarting from series 8, the show was given a brand new set.\nOn 25 March 2016, the show released the #renametheLastLeg hashtag on Twitter live on the set to allow viewers to choose a new name for the show.\nThe show brought the number of choices down to the four most popular ones and then they released a Twitter poll to change the name of the programme for next week's final episode of the series.\nIt later concluded that the poll received a total of 3,731 votes with the highest scoring programme name being 'Your Mum' with a 30% vote.\nThe last episode of the series aired on 1 April 2016 and was called \"Your Mum\".\nDuring one 2016 Summer Paralympics episode on 14 September 2016, host Adam Hills announced that the show was to be renamed again, this time in Paralympic athlete Libby Clegg's honour.\nThe remainder of that show was called \"The Fast Clegg\".\nThe show aired a two-hour special entitled \"Re-United Kingdom\" dedicated to MP Jo Cox on 16 June 2017 (the anniversary of her death).\nFeaturing dozens of comedians and politicians, the show aimed to inspire the public to resolve animosity between people they had fallen out with.\nPoliticians appeared in pre-recorded skits where they were stuck in a lift with another politician they disliked, and found common ground; some members of the public who had resolved arguments with each other were shown in a hot tub together.\nAdam Hills was quoted as saying \"If the Paralympics is covered well, it can change the way Jim Davidson looks at and treats people with disabilities\".\n\"The Daily Mirror\" described \"The Last Leg\" as \"a real success\".\nColin Robertson for \"The Sun\" said that the show's success was down to the simple fact that you \"can\" joke about disability\u00a0\u2013 you just need to know what you can say.\nVeteran TV pundit Clive James said: \"Taken as a whole, the Channel 4 coverage of the Paralympics was very good, but almost the best part of it was The Last Leg, the discussion show at the end of each day\".\nThe programme provoked a discussion in the media about whether disability and comedy could work

the rioters assaulted the prostitutes and looted the properties.\nMany thousand London apprentices could neither afford their prostitutes nor, due to their own working contracts, legally marry.\nSome of the brothels were supported by the patronage of King Charles II were representative of Charles's continental Catholic-style court, awash with unaffordable debauchery.\nFollowing the riot, a satirical petition began to circulate, addressed from Page and Cresswell and other London madams.\nWritten to Lady Castlemaine, the King's lover, notorious for her own wild promiscuity, the brothel owners requested that the aristocrat act on the behalf of her 'sisters' and repay the madams for the rebuilding of their brothels, funded by the national tax coffers.\nThey address Castlemaine as a prostitute herself, a great practitioner of \"venereal pleasures\", and list the sites of the brothels where her fellows struggle.\nIt is addressed as:\nThe Poor Whores' Petition to the most splendid, illustrious, serene and eminent Lady of Pleasure the Countess of Castlemayne &c: The humble petition of the undone company of poore distressed whores, bawds, pimps, and panders\u00a0...\nSigned by us, Madam Cresswell and Damaris Page, in the behalf of our sisters and fellow sufferers (in this day of our calamity) in Dog and Bitch Yard, Lukenor\u2019s Lane, Saffron Hill, Moorfields, Chiswell Street, Rosemary Lane, Nightingale Lane, Ratcliffe Highway, Well Close, East Smithfield etc.\nGiven her great experience in whoring, Lady Castlemaine would, they argued, be able to deeply sympathise with prostitutes across the city.\n\"Should your Eminency but once fall into these Rough hands\", they wrote, \"you may expect no more Favour than they have shewn unto us poor Inferiour Whores\".\nSome historians, such as Linnane, infer an active role of the addressers Page and Cresswell in the writing of the document.\nOthers such as Mowry and Turner suggest it is an organ of political ventriloquism on behalf of anonymous, radical dissenters; a \"bogus work\" and \"pseudo-female\".\nThe agenda of the Petition may be interpreted in varied ways.\nIt may taken as an anti-royalist work, lampooning Charles's court as \"the great bawdy house at Whitehall\", in Pepys's words.\nCharles was suspected of being a practising Catholic; his wife, Catherine of Braganza and brother, heir to the throne, and the future James II, were openly so, and the family was close to the French royal court.\nThe work may be seen to mock this continental, Popish affiliation: In return for patronage, the writers offer to venerate Lady Castlemaine as their sister prostitutes in Rome and Venice venerated the Pope.\nHowever, as historian James Grantham Turner underlines, there may have been no political agenda to the letter, as Castlemaine was already the target of court wits and city satire for her lascivious reputation.\nThe petition was a brazen act of transgressive, public satire and diarist Samuel Pepys noted that Castlemaine was \"horribly vexed\" by it.\nHe writes \"the times are loose and come to a great disregard of the King or Court.\"\nThe letter itself was so finely tuned to the political dynamics of the day that though the printer was arrested, the court censor writes that \"I can fasten nothing on \"The Poor Whore's Petition\" that a jury will take notice of.\"\nThe Petition caused a flurry of broadside satires, poems and ballads on the subject through the following year.\nThe historian James Turner terms this event as an example of a new carnivalisation of sexuality in Restoration England, where genuine political attack, satire, street commentary and bawdy theatre came together.\nMany anonymous, satirical broadside responses to the Petition circulated in the London coffee houses.\nThey included four pamphlets entitled \"The Gracious answer of the most illustrious lady of pleasure, the Countess of Castlem---- to the poor-whores petition\"; \"The Prentices' Answer to the Whores' Petition\"; \"The Most gracious answer of Dame Barbara CountesseofC to the peticion of undone, poore, and distressed company of Whores\" and \"The Citizen's Reply to the Whores' Petition and the Prentices' Answer\".\nTurner comments: \"These broadsides were indeed printed, distributed, and enjoyed by the radical underground; by changing their style from fiery sermonizing to sexual mockery and ventriloquistic parody, anti-monarchist dissidents exploit the amphibiousness of festive-aggressive satire.\"\nThey represented further political ventriloquism, especially on behalf of lady Castlemaine.\nTurner describes the transgressive satires as \"mingling the political protest against absolutism and corruption with the misogynistic hatred of 'female' secrecy, passion, and influence.\nCastlemaine becomes a figure of extravagance and carnivalesque theatricality, an embodiment of the kind of libertines and radicals in early modern London."}

had limited success as a sire of winners.\nChief Singer was a dark brown, almost black horse standing 16.3 hands high with a white blaze and two white feet.\nHe was the best horse sired by Ballad Rock, an Irish sprinter whose best win came in the Greenlands Stakes.\nAt stud, Ballad Rock suffered from health problems which limited his fertility: Chief Singer was one of only ten foals he sired in 1981.\nHis dam, Principia, was a minor winner in France and a daughter of the 1967 Epsom Oaks winner Pia.\nAs a yearling Chief Singer was sent to the sales.\nHis unusual size did not appeal to prospective owners and he was bought for the relatively low price of 10,000 guineas by Jeff Smith.\nThe colt was sent into training with the former jockey Ron Sheather at his Park Lodge stable in Newmarket, Suffolk.\nChief Singer was the first major winner for his regular jockey Ray Cochrane.\nChief Singer never ran in a maiden race and was unusual in that his entire career was spent in Group Race company.\nOn his first racecourse appearance he was sent to Royal Ascot in June where he ran in the six furlong Coventry Stakes.\nShortly before the race, Sheather had matched the colt against a successful six-year-old handicapper named Teamwork in a trial gallop, and decided to send the colt straight to Ascot after he easily defeated his older rival despite meeting him at two stones worse than weight-for-age.\nIn the Coventry Stakes, Chief Singer started a 20/1 outsider in a field of fourteen runners.\nBefore the race Lester Piggott asked Cochrane how he expected to win on \"that big black oaf\".\nCochrane responded \"take a good look at his face, because all you're going to see at the end is his arse\".\nChief Singer started poorly and was left behind by his opponents but made up the lost ground, took the lead entering the final furlong, and drew away to win by four lengths.\nTimeform praised his \"extraordinary turn of foot\" and called his victory a \"scintillating display\".\nAfter the race, Jeff Smith reportedly received many large offers for the colt, but refused to sell.\nA month later, Chief Singer started favourite for the July Stakes at Newmarket.\nHe pulled hard on the way to the start and fought his jockey's attempts to restrain him during the race before finishing fifth of the six runners behind Superlative.\nAfter the race, Chief Singer's performances in training deteriorated sharply, with Shearer reporting that the horse seemed unable to even canter.\nA succession of veterinary examinations failed to find any physical explanation and the colt did not race again in 1983.\nOn his first run as a three-year-old, Chief Singer was sent to contest the Group Three 2000 Guineas Trial Stakes over seven furlongs at Salisbury Racecourse in April.\nRunning for the first time in more than nine months he finished second of the seventeen runners beaten a length by Rousillon who was carrying five pounds less.\nIn May Chief Singer started a 20/1 outsider in a field of nine for the 2000 Guineas at Newmarket, with El Gran Senor being made the 15/8 favourite ahead of Lear Fan, Keen and Rainbow Quest in what was considered an unusually strong running of the classic.\nAfter being last in the early stages he moved forward to take the lead approaching the final furlong but was immediately challenged by El Gran Senor.\nThe two colts quickly drew away from the rest of the field, with the favourite prevailing by one and a half lengths and Chief Singer finishing four lengths clear of Lear Fan in third.\nIn June, a year after his last win, Chief Singer returned to Royal Ascot for the St James's Palace Stakes (then a Group Two race) over one mile.\nStarting the 85/40 favourite, Chief Singer again started slowly but moved up to fourth place entering the straight.\nCochrane sent him into the lead two furlongs out and the colt accelerated clear of the field to win by eight lengths from Keen and Kalim in a track record time of 1:38.90.\nOn his next appearance, Chief Singer ran in the July Cup, at that time the only all-aged Group One race in Europe over six furlongs, in which his opposition included the leading sprinters Habibti, Committed and Never So Bold.\nCochrane and Chief Singer were towards the rear of the field for the first half of the race before accelerating through a gap to take the lead a furlong from the finish.\nHe won by one and a half lengths from Never So Bold, with Committed third and Habibti sixth.\nOnly four horses appeared to oppose Chief Singer at Goodwood in early August when he attempted to become the second horse, after the Irish-trained Thatch in 1973 to win the one mile Sussex Stakes after winning the St James's Palace Stakes and the July Cup.\nThe race developed into a struggle between Chief Singer and Rousillon, the horse who had beaten him at Salisbury.\nThe closing stages were unusually rough, with Rousillon hanging to the right and bumping his rival several times, as Cochrane tried to challenge on the inside rail.\nCochrane had to resort to the whip to get the favourite to the post half a length ahead of his rival, with the pair finishing seven lengths clear of the rest.\nAfter an enquiry by the racecourse stewards, Rousillon was disqualified from second and placed last with his jockey Greville Starkey, being found guilty of \"reckless riding\".\nSheather then moved Chief Singer up in distance for the Benson & Hedges Gold Cup over ten and a half furlongs at York.\nThe colt failed to reproduce his best form as he finished third behind the four-year-olds Cormorant Wood and Tolomeo, one place ahead of Sadler's Wells.\nHis apparent failure to stay led to plans to run him in the Champion Stakes being abandoned and he next appeared in the Queen Elizabeth II Stakes over one mile at Ascot in late September.\nChief Singer bolted on the way to the start and it took Cochrane some time to bring the horse under control.\nWhen the race began he was left behind at the start and was never in contention at any stage, finishing tailed-off in last place behind Teleprompter.\nHe was then retired to stud with a valuation of \u00a34.8 million.\nIn the official International Classification for 1983, Chief Singer was given a rating of 75, thirteen pounds below the top-rated two-year-old El Gran Senor.\nIn 1984, his rating of 92 was the highest for any British three-year-old and the fourth highest for any European horse behind El Gran Senor (98), Teenoso (95) and Sagace (93).\nIn the same year he was given a rating of 131 by the independent Timeform organisation, making him their top-rated sprint horse.\nHe was also the winner of the Gilbey European Champion Racehorse award, based on points accrued by performances in major races during the season.\nChief Singer stood as a stallion at the Side Hill stud at Newmarket and was later exported to stand at the Hauptgestut Graditz in Germany where he died in 2000.\nThe best of his offspring were the Listed flat race winner Alidiva and the successful National Hunt performer Chief's Song.\nAlidiva, however, proved to be an exceptional broodmare, producing the Group One winners Sleepytime, Taipan (Preis von Europa, Premio Roma) and Ali-Royal (Sussex Stakes)."}

{"id": "36957127", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36957127", "title": "Broodiness", "text": "Broodiness\nBroodiness is the action or behavioral tendency to sit on a clutch of eggs to incubate them, often requiring the non-expression of many other behaviors including feeding and drinking.\nBeing broody has been defined as \"Being in a state of readiness to brood eggs that is characterized by cessation of laying and by marked changes in behavior and physiology\".\nBroody birds often pluck feathers from their chest and abdomen, using them to cover the eggs.\nAs a consequence of this, they develop one or several patches of bare skin on the ventral surface.\nThese reddish, well-vascularized areas of skin are usually called brood patches, and improve heat transfer to the eggs.\nBroodiness is usually associated with female birds, although males of some bird species become broody and some non-avian animals also show broodiness.\nIn wild birds, egg incubation is a normal and essential phase in the process of reproduction, and in many families of birds, e.g.\npigeons, the eggs are incubated by both male and female parents.\nIn all the species of phalaropes the males become broody rather than the female.\nThe females leave the nest after finishing laying to let the males incubate the eggs and take care of the young.\nMale emus (\"Dromaius novaehollandiae\") become broody after their mates start laying, and begin to incubate the eggs before the laying period is complete.\nA small number of atypical birds such as \"Passeriformes\" of the genus \"Molothrus\" (cowbirds) do not become broody but lay their eggs in the nests of other species for incubation, known as brood parasitism.\nThe Australian Brushturkey \"(Alectura lathami)\" also does not become broody, rather, it covers the eggs with a large mound of vegetable matter, which decomposes, keeping the eggs warm until hatching.\nThe Crab-plover, (\"Dromas ardeola\"), which lives on the coasts and islands of the Indian Ocean, lets its eggs incubate primarily by the heat of the sun, and will leave its nest unattended, occasionally for days at a time.\nBroody hens can be recognized by their behaviour.\nThey sit firmly over the eggs, and when people approach or try to remove the eggs, threaten the person by erecting their feathers, emitting a characteristic sound like \"clo-clo-clo\" and will peck aggressively.\nWhen broody, hens often temporarily cease eating or reduce their feed consumption.\nLetting eggs accumulate in a relatively dark place near the floor often stimulates hens to become broody.\nPlacing artificial eggs into nests also stimulates broodiness.\nKeeping hens in dark places with warm temperatures and in view of vocalising orphan chicks can induce broodiness, even in breeds that normally do not go broody.\nSome environmental conditions stimulate broodiness.\nIn heavy breeds of chickens, warm weather tends to bring about broodiness.\nRemoving eggs each day, out of the sight of the hens, helps avoid broodiness not only in domestic poultry but also in some wild species in captivity.\nThis continued egg laying means more eggs are laid than would occur under natural conditions.\nPoultry farming in battery cages also helps to avoid broodiness.\nBecause hens stop laying when they become broody, commercial poultry breeders perceive broodiness not as a normal physiological process, but as an impediment to egg and poultry meat production.\nWith domestication, it has become more profitable to incubate eggs artificially, while keeping hens in full egg production.\nTo help achieve this, there has been intense artificial selection for non-broodiness in commercial egg laying chickens and parent stock of poultry.\nAs a result of this artificial selection, broodiness has been reduced to very low levels in present-day breeds of commercial fowl, both among egg-laying and meat-producing breeds.\nBroodiness is due to the secretion of the hormone prolactin by the anterior lobe of the hypophysis.\nProlactin injection in hens provokes egg laying to stop within a few days, vitellum reabsorption, ovary regression (hens only have a left ovary) and finally broodiness.\nHowever, attempts to stop broodiness by the administration of several hormones have failed because this state, once evoked, requires time to revert.\nProlactin injections inhibit the production of gonadotropin hormone, a hormone that stimulates ovarian follicles which is produced in the frontal lobe of hypophysis.\nCastrated males can go broody with baby chicks, showing that broodiness is not limited to females, however, castrated males do not incubate eggs.\nContrary to common opinion, the temperature of broody hens barely differs from that of laying hens.\nBroody hens pluck feathers from their chest, using them to cover the eggs.\nAs a consequence of this, they develop one or several patches of bare skin on the ventral surface.\nThese reddish, well-vascularized areas of skin are usually called brood patches.\nwhich improve heat transfer to the eggs.\nBroodiness is more common in some chicken breeds than others, indicating that it is a heritable characteristic.\nBreeds such as Cochin, Cornish and Silkie exhibit a tendency to broodiness, including brooding eggs from other species such as quails, pheasants, turkeys and geese.\nIn some breeds such as the White Leghorn, broodiness is extremely rare.\nSome studies on crosses of chicken breeds point to the hypothesis of complementary genes acting on broodiness.\nOther results point to the hypothesis of sex-linked genes, or, inheritance through the maternal chromosome.\nAlthough these studies have been made on different breeds of chickens, their results are not contradictory.\nThere is common agreement that artificial selection for egg production succeeded in reducing the incidence of broody hens in chicken populations.\nThere is some evidence that non-avian dinosaurs also practiced brooding.\nA specimen of the Mongolian oviraptorid \"Citipati osmolskae\" was discovered in a chicken-like brooding position in 1993, which may indicate that they had begun using an insulating layer of feathers to keep the eggs warm.\nSeveral deinonychosaur and oviraptorosaur specimens have also been found preserved on top of their nests, likely brooding in a bird-like manner.\nLungless salamanders in the family \"Plethodontidae\" lay a small number of eggs in a cluster among damp leaf litter.\nThe female salamander often broods the eggs and in the genus \"Ensatinas\", she has been observed to coil around them and press her throat area against them, effectively massaging them with a mucous secretion.\nThe black mountain salamander mother broods her eggs, guarding them from predation as the larvae feed on the yolks of their eggs.\nThey eventually break their way out of the egg capsules and disperse.\nSome species of Gymnophiona (caecilians, with long, cylindrical, limbless bodies) brood their eggs.\nMost pythons coil around their egg-clutches and remain with them until they hatch.\nA female python will not leave the eggs, except to occasionally bask in the sun or drink water.\nShe will even \u201cshiver\u201d to generate heat to incubate the eggs.\nSome cichlid fish lay their eggs in the open, on rocks, leaves, or logs.\nMale and female parents usually engage in differing brooding roles.\nMost commonly, the male patrols the pair's territory and repels intruders, while females fan water over the eggs, removing the infertile and leading the fry while foraging.\nHowever, both sexes are able to perform the full range of parenting behaviours.\nMouthbrooding, also known as oral incubation, refers to the care given by some groups of animals to fertilized eggs or their offspring by holding them in the mouth of the parent for extended periods of time.\nAlthough it has been observed in a variety of animals, most mouthbrooders are fish.\nThe parent performing this behavior invariably feeds less often and afterwards will be underweight, requiring a period of feeding and restoring the depleted energy reserves.\nMarsupial frogs are so-called because they possess a dorsal brood pouch.\nIn some species the eggs are fertilized on the female's lower back, and are inserted in her pouch with the aid of the male's toes.\nThe eggs remain in contact with the female's vascular tissue, which provides them oxygen.\nSome animals have a common name that includes the word 'brood' or its derivatives, although it is arguable whether the animals show 'broodiness' per se.\nFor example, the female gastric-brooding frog (\"Rheobatrachus sp.\")\nfrom Australia, now probably extinct, swallows her fertilized eggs, which then develop inside her stomach.\nShe ceases to feed and stops secreting stomach acid and the tadpoles rely on the yolks of the eggs for nourishment.\nAfter six or seven weeks the mother opens her mouth wide and regurgitates the tadpoles which hop away from her mouth.\nThe Brooding sea anemone (\"Epiactis prolifera\") is a colonial hermaphrodite that fertilizes and incubates its eggs internally.\nThe motile larvae, after swimming out of the mouth, migrate down to the disk and become fixed there until they become little anemones, ready to move and feed independently.\nIn Darwin's Frog (\"Rhinoderma darwinii\"), the female lays about 30 eggs and then the male guards them for about two weeks, until they hatch.\nThe male then takes all the survivors and carries around the developing young in his vocal pouch.\nWhen the tiny tadpoles have developed they hop out and swim away.\nIn this animal, the parents hold the hatched young rather than eggs in

Vogeler, Commander of the Army Chemical Corps, responding to the commanding officer of the 196th Ordnance Battalion, the history of the 267th Chemical Platoon was outlined as follows:<br>\nIn compliance with para 6, 2nd [Logistical Command] Log Comd Bulletin, dated 11 March 1966, the following data is submitted.\nORGANIZATIONAL HISTORY - 267th Chemical Company:\nThe 267th Chemical Company was activated on Okinawa on 1 December 1962 as 267th Chemical Platoon (SVC).\nPrior to assignment to Okinawa, key personnel attended an [on the job training] (OJT) depot operations course at Rocky Mountain Arsenal, Colorado.\nThe platoon leader; 1/Lt James D. Saunders, CmlC, along with thirty-five NCOs and EM [enlisted men] began establishing operating procedures for the newly activated unit.\nThe 267th Chemical Platoon (SVC) had the mission of operation of Site 2, DOD Project 112.\nThe Unit was assigned to the U.S. Army Ordnance Group, USARYIS [United States Army, Ryukyu Islands] and Unit personnel attached to Chibana Troop Headquarters for rations and billeting.\nAll Unit personnel were actively engaged in preparing RED HAT area, Site 2, for the receipt and storage of first increment items, YBA DOD Project 112.\nA security officer, 1/Lt Samuel Negra, Inf, was assigned to the platoon.\nFirst increment items, designated Code YBA arrived on Okinawa in May 1963.\nDue to limited assigned personnel, the Platoon was augmented with Army and other Armed Forces personnel to assist in storage of these items.\nMarine Corps personnel were utilized as security guards for the RED HAT Area.\nUpon completion of storage of YBA items, normal duties were exercised in the Unit, pending arrival of second increment, YBB, items.\nDuring the interim period between completion of YBA and arrival of YBB in May 1964, Unit Security Section was augmented with temporary duty personnel to function as security guards and sentry dog handlers.\nSuch personnel were usually assigned to the Unit for a ninety-day (90-day) day period.\nSecond increment items arrived on Okinawa in May 1964.\nThe platoon was again augmented with Army and other Armed Forces personnel to accomplish storage of these items.\nUpon completion of storage of YBB items, the Platoon Leader was reassigned and replaced by 1/Lt Samuel Negra, Inf.\nAn additional officer 2/Lt Ronald Minkow, CmlC, was assigned as Storage Officer.\nThe platoon was reassigned to the U. S. Army Supply Services Command.\n1/Lt Charles H. Vogeler, CmlC, was assigned to the platoon in February 1965 and assumed command shortly thereafter.\n1st Lt. Willie D. Greene, CmlC, was assigned in April 1965.\nPreparation was being made for the receipt of 3rd Increment, items, designated Code YBF, in May 1965.\nStorage of YBF items was completed in August 1965.\nThe unit was reassigned to the U.S. Army Supply Maintenance Command in September 1965.\nThis command was redesignated U. S. Army Depot, Okinawa shortly thereafter with assignment, to the 2nd Logistical Command.\nThe 267th Chemical Platoon (SVC) was redesignated 267th Chemical Company, 16 November 1965, pursuant to U.S. Army Pacific General Order 323 (USARPAC GO #323).\nAuthorized strength was increased from two (2) officers and seventy-two (72) EM to four (4) officers and one hundred fifty-five (155) EM.\nIn January 1966, the Unit was assigned to the 196th Ord.\nBn.\n(Ammo) (DS), which arrived on Okinawa in December, 1965.\n[signed]\nCharles H. Vogeler Capt, CmlC, Commanding\nFor its outstanding contributions to fulfillment of the 2d Logistics mission, the 267th Chemical Company was awarded the Meritorious Unit Citation for 18 military operations in Southeast Asia during the period of October 1965 to December 1966.\nAccording to unit records obtained from the Chemical Corps museum, the 267th Chemical Company either deployed to Vietnam or supported operations there from February 1966 to August 1967 and from July 1, 1970, to December 31, 1971.\nAfter a nerve gas leak in 1969 injured 23 members of the 267th and one civilian, the United States Government had directed the removal of all toxic gases from Okinawa, Japan.\nThe relocation mission brought about Operation Red Hat which was internationally publicized.\nThe removal operation of all chemical munitions from Okinawa resulted in the 1971 relocation of the chemical weapons and the redeployment of the 267th Chemical Company to Johnston Atoll in the Central Pacific during Operation Red Hat.\nThe cargo discharge from the USNS Private Francis X. McGraw (T-AK-241) at Johnston Island on September 21, 1971, completed the movement phase of Operation Red Hat, and the 276th Chemical Company commanded by Cpt.\nGoforth, Cml Corps., completed its redeployment to Johnston Atoll on Sept. 27, 1971.\nThe unit replaced the USARHAW Provisional Detachment assigned to Johnston Atoll in Jun 1971 and commanded by 1Lt Darwyn Walker, Cml Corps, and two enlisted personnel who were assigned to prepare for the arrival of the company and munitions.\nThe Provisional Detachment had reported to Col. Gill, Commander, USARHAW Munitions Division.\n1Lt Walker joined the 267th Chemical Company upon its arrival as the Executive Officer and became the Operations Officer for the Red Hat Munition Depot.\nFor receiving and storing the munitions, the 267th Chemical Company was augmented with two Terminal Service Companies from Fort Eustis, a Technical Escort Detachment from Edgewood Arsenal and a hard hat Navy salvage vessel which included Navy EOD personnel.\nReceiving, inventorying, and storage operations were conducted daily for 90 consecutive days.\nFor outstanding execution of Operation Red Hat, members of the 267th Chemical Company were commended by General Westmoreland, General Rossen, Lieutenant General Lambert, Major General Hayes, and Major General Pennington when the unit was awarded its second Meritorious Unit Commendation.\nNumerous reorganizations and authorized strength changes took place between September 27, 1971, when the unit arrived at Johnston Island and late 1979 during a time when the unit was assigned between the U.S. Army, Pacific, Forces Command, and Western Command.\nA May 1975 letter to a member of the 267th Chemical Company from his Commander notes that the primary mission on Johnston Island consisted of maintaining a forty-one acre chemical munitions storage area, called Red Hat, having forty-three storage structures containing about 13,000 tons of munitions.\nA Johnston Atoll orientation packet from the same time period explains that the mission of the 267th Chemical Company, noted to also be known as \"Red Hat,\" was to provide for the storage, maintenance, security, issuance, and surveillance of chemical munitions.\nIn 1976 the company came under the 45th General Support Group.\nIn October 1983, the 267th Chemical Company was re-designated under the Johnston Island Chemical Activity.\nThis re-designation included the assignment of a platoon of Military Police for security.\nOn November 9, 1984, the Vice Chief of Staff of the Army, General Maxwell Thurman, visited Johnston Atoll and initiated significant changes to the structure of the organization.\nOn July 8, 1985, Johnston Island Chemical Activity became the United States Army Chemical Activity, Western Command, a major subordinate command of Western Command.\nThe change included the reorganization of the chemical activity at Johnston island into three components called the Military Police Company (MPC) to provide physical security for toxic chemical munitions and facilities located on Johnston Island Atoll, and on order, conduct island defense; the Headquarters / Headquarters Detachment (HHD) to provide administrative support including personnel and budget management, logistical support, chemical surety matters, personnel security, training management, treaty compliance and on order, support the deployment of a response force for personnel decontamination operations in the Pacific area of response; and the Chemical Ammunition Support Division (CASD) to handle the poison munitions.\nSubsequently, on August 30, 1990, the activity was renamed the U.S. Army Chemical Activity, Pacific (USACAP) to coincide with the re-designation of U.S. Army, Pacific Command.\nWorldwide attention was focused on Johnston Atoll that same year, when chemical munitions were moved from West Germany, under the code name Operation Steel Box.\"\nDuring the period of June 1990 to June 1991, USACAP had assisted in the start-up of the Johnston Atoll Chemical Agent Disposal System (JACADS), the transfer of retrograde of chemical munitions from Germany during Operation Steel Box, and the recovery of chemical munitions from the Solomon Islands in Operation Kalama Express.\nThese events resulted in the unit receiving the U.S. Army Superior Unit Award on July 20, 1992, from the Secretary of the Army.\nIn October 1993 the Department of the Army\u2019s Environmental Support Group noted that the mission of the 267th Chemical Company on Johnston Atoll was overseeing the \"storage, safeguard, maintenance, and security for ready to issue chemical agents;\" rabbits were used as \"live monitors\" and \"VX\" rockets were assigned to the island.\nOn November 1, 1994, USACAP reorganized by combining the HHC and CASD into one unit called the Chemical Ammunition Company (CAC).\nOn November 29, 2000, the last of the chemical weapons at JACADS was disposed of.\nThe last disposal operation destroyed more than 13,000 VX filled land mines.\nThe island had held over 400,000 rockets, projectiles, bombs, mortars, containers and mines.\nThe U.S. Army Chemical Activity Pacific (USACAP) was deactivated during a Chemical Surety Decertification ceremony on Johnston Island held on April 11, 2001.\nThe ceremony signaled the completion of 30 years of guarding America's cache of chemical weapons in the Pacific.\nThe chemical unit and its predecessor's sole mission had been to guard chemical weapons shipped from Okinawa beginning in 1971.\nTwo years after the last chemical weapons on Johnston Atoll at were destroyed, the Army submitted the plan to dismantle the JACADS facility which the United States Environmental Protection Agency approved in September 2002.\nDemolition on the facility, home to the incinerators, laboratories and control rooms, took place from August\u2013October 2003, and by November 2003, all infrastructure had been removed from the Atoll.\nA plaque dedicated to JACADS personnel was placed on Johnston Island at that time.\nBy 2001 the 267th Chemical Company was stationed at Camp Carroll in Waegwan, South Korea and assigned to the 23rd Chemical Battalion as part of 19th Theater Support Command (Provisional).\nThe unit was charged with decontaminating personnel and equipment in the aftermath of a potential North Korean chemical attack.\nOn June 24, 2004, the 23d Chemical Battalion was ordered to inactivate the 267th Chemical Company.\nThe 23rd Chemical Battalion was then reassigned to Fort Lewis, Washington in late 2004."}

M. Dobell, met little resistance.\nGerman forces who had been occupying the coast had withdrawn along the northern railway to Dschang, along the Wuri River to Jabassi, and along the midland railway to Edea.\nFrom these positions, the Allied commander feared the Germans could easily attack Douala.\nDue to heavy rains, roads to Dachang, Jabassi, and Edea were washed out and impassable; however, Dobell felt that high water in the Wuri River made a boat-borne assault on Jabassi feasible.\nSix companies of the West Africa Regiment, two from the 1st Nigerians, one from the Gold Coast Regiment, and about 100 Royal Navy sailors and marines were assigned to the task.\nOn 7 October, British forces under the command of Brigadier General Edmund Howard Gorges sailed up the Wuri river in barges with four field guns including a 6-pounder gun placed on a dredger.\nThey landed five kilometers away from Jabassi and marched their way through the jungle to the German entrenchments.\nOnce in the thick bush, British forces lost unity and coordination.\nIn open ground in front of German entrenchments, they came under intense machine gun fire which forced them to retreat back into the bush.\nAfter regrouping they attempted to flank the German forces but failed, forcing them to once again retreat.\nThe order was given to withdraw back on the river to Duala.\nThe Germans lost four of the 26 Europeans at Jabassi.\nThe following week, on 14 October, the Wuri river was again high enough for another attempt to take Jabassi.\nWith two six-inch artillery pieces and reinforcements, British forces landed on both banks of the Wuri and advanced towards the German entrenchments, while General Gorges coordinated the assault from a boat.\nThis engagement was victorious for the British, capturing ten Europeans and the station.\nThis battle resulted in further German withdrawal into the mountainous interior of Kamerun.\nIt also gave more protection to the Allied landing forces at Douala and Victoria from a feared German counter-attack."}

organised by the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale des \u00c9checs (FIDE) and comprising an Open and Women's tournament, as well as several events designed to promote the game of chess, was held in Baku, Azerbaijan, from 1\u201314 September 2016.\nIt was the first time that the Chess Olympiad had been hosted in Azerbaijan, the birthplace of former world champion Garry Kasparov; however, Azerbaijan had previously hosted strong tournaments, including the annual Shamkir Chess super-tournament in memory of Vugar Gashimov (1986\u20132014) and the Chess World Cup 2015.\nThe total number of participants was 1,587, with 894 in the Open and 693 in the Women's event.\nThe number of registered teams was 180 from 175 countries in the Open section and 142 from 138 countries in the Women's section.\nBoth sections set team participation records.\nEritrea, Kosovo, and South Sudan competed in the tournament for the first time.\nThe venue of the Chess Olympiad was the Baku Crystal Hall.\nThe Chief Arbiter of the event was Azerbaijan's International Arbiter Faiq Hasanov.\nThe United States won the gold medal in the Open event for the first time since 1976 and for the sixth time overall, while China won their fifth gold medal in the Women's event and the first since 1994 after winning the silver medal in the last three Olympiads.\nUkrainian player Andrei Volokitin, who played as a reserve player, was the best individual player in the Open event with 8 out of 9 points (eight wins and one draw), with a performance rating of 2992.\nRussian Valentina Gunina, playing on board two, was the best individual player in the Women's event with 8 out of 10 points (seven wins, two draws and one loss), with a performance rating of 2643.\nThe bidding procedure for the 42nd Chess Olympiad and the FIDE Congress in connection with a possible bid for the Chess World Cup 2015 was opened in December 2011.\nEach city interested to host the event had to submit their bid to FIDE by 31

4.3 pertaining to the organising committee, finances, and provision of amenities and stipends, respectively.\nThree cities submitted bids to host the event: Albena, Tallinn and Baku.\nThe final decision was made at the 83rd FIDE Congress in September 2012 in Istanbul.\nOut of the three bidding cities, the applications of Albena and Tallinn were not accepted as they both failed to make presentations before the voting.\nThereafter, discussions started about Baku's nomination and two concerns were raised.\nThe first was the protest by the Armenian representatives against holding the Olympiad in Azerbaijan, who stated that the Armenian chess players would find it difficult to play in Baku, since the two nations were in armed conflict.\nThe second concern was related to the difficulties that the participants may have in obtaining a visa to enter the country.\nIn his speech during the congress, Azerbaijani Minister of Youth and Sports Azad Rahimov said that Armenian sportsmen had already visited Azerbaijan and participated in competitions, where they were provided with security guarantees that had been met, and no incident was ever recorded.\nHe also mentioned the victory of Russian Armenian boxer Misha Aloyan in the 2011 AIBA World Boxing Championships held in Baku as an example that Armenians can not only participate but also win.\nWith regard to the visa issue, Rahimov mentioned the positive experience with the Eurovision Song Contest 2012, where all participants received their visas on arrival at the airport without any problem.\nHe also added that the Armenian sportsmen will also get visas easily.\nThe next speaker was FIDE President Kirsan Ilyumzhinov, who suggested that the 42nd Chess Olympiad should take place in Baku and mentioned that there are four years for the Azerbaijani-Armenian conflict to be resolved before the event.\nHis proposal was supported by the delegates and the FIDE Congress awarded the Chess Olympiad 2016 to Baku, and the Chess World Cup 2015 for the year before.\nThe organising committee of the Chess Olympiad consisted of fourteen prominent Azerbaijani dignitaries.\nHead of the committee was the First Deputy Prime Minister of Azerbaijan Yaqub Eyyubov, while the other members include the Minister of Youth and Sport Azad Rahimov, the Minister of Culture and Tourism Abulfas Garayev, the Minister of Healthcare Ogtay Shiraliyev, the Governor of the Central Bank Azerbaijan and President of the Azerbaijan Chess Federation Elman Rustamov, the Mayor of Baku Hajibala Abutalybov, the CEO of SOCAR Rovnag Abdullayev, the Minister of Foreign Affairs Elmar Mammadyarov, the Minister of Internal Affairs Ramil Usubov, the Minister of Finance Samir Sharifov, the Chairman of the State Customs Committee Aydin Aliyev, the Chief of the State Migration Service Firudin Nabiyev, the Vice-President of the Azerbaijan Chess Federation Mahir Mammadov, and the Vice-President of the Azerbaijan Chess Federation and Chief Arbiter of the 42nd Chess Olympiad Faiq Hasanov.\nIn addition to the organising committee, there was an operating committee of six members in charge of the preparations whose director was Mahir Mammadov.\nIn May 2016, the operating committee named three Azerbaijani artists as \"Celebrity Ambassadors\": the theatre producer Mushivq Abbasov, and the theatre actors Joshgun Rahimov and Rafael Isgandarov.\nIn July 2016, the Olympic gold-medal winning wrestler Farid Mansurov became the fourth celebrity ambassador.\nThe Chess Olympiad was initially planned to take place from 17 to 30 September 2016.\nNevertheless, the organisers have wished to change the dates of the Olympiad because of the school holidays and the availability of hotels.\nOn February 16, FIDE announced that the dates for the Olympiad have been moved to 1\u201314 September, while the dates for the 87th FIDE Congress to 4\u201314 September 2016.\nFIDE have also approached the organisers of the World Youth Chess Championship in Khanty Mansiysk, who were able to change their dates to 20 September\u20134 October 2016, in order to avoid clash of dates.\nOn 18 February, the organisers of the Sinquefield Cup 2016 announced that the dates for their tournament had been moved to 4\u201316 August because of the rescheduling of the Olympiad.\nThe venue of the Chess Olympiad was the Baku Crystal Hall.\nIt was built in order to host the Eurovision Song Contest from 22 to 26 May 2012.\nIn late 2012, Jennifer Lopez, Shakira and Rihanna also performed concerts there.\nIn March 2014, the final four tournament of the 2013\u201314 CEV Women's Champions League took place in the hall.\nIn June 2015, it hosted the boxing, karate, taekwondo, fencing and volleyball events during the inaugural 2015 European Games.\nThe total area of the complex is 30,958\u00a0m, while the area of the arena is 10,964\u00a0m. Its height in the middle is 24\u00a0m. The arena is lit by 12,000 LED light points with a lighting rate of 850 lux at 1\u00a0m height.\nThe corridor around the arena is divided into two symmetrical parts with 15 entrances on each side, including 30 outside entrances.\nEach sector has 2 transport access points (1 on each side), 10 arena entrances (5 on each side) and 16 tribune access points (8 on each side).\nAlong the corridor, there are 10 beverage facilities (5 in each sector), 18 catering facilities (9 in each sector), 2 first aid points (1 in each sector), 36 toilets (6 for men, 6 for women and 6 for persons with physical disabilities in each sector).\nThe hall has 12,000 seats but can accommodate 27,000 people.\nThe building has a crystalline shape and illuminated fa\u00e7ade with numerous LED lights.\nIts shape and fa\u00e7ade are response to Azerbaijan's special request for the creation of a widely visible and visually effective landmark as a bridge between Asia and Europe that will be noticed in an international context.\nThe LED lights were upgraded to allow different dynamic lighting scenarios to appear in order to highlight the membrane fa\u00e7ade and create moods appropriate for the different stages of the events.\nThe budget for the Olympiad was 13.3 million euros.\nSome 6.8 million euros were set aside for the first-class accommodation for the players and delegates, while another 1 million euros went to the FIDE Commission for World Championships & Olympiads and intellectual rights.\nThe opening ceremony was held on 1 September in the National Gymnastics Arena.\nThe central area of the stage was slightly elevated and turned into a chessboard by lights from above.\nThe ceremony began with a performance presenting the theme \"the sea: the source of life\", which was followed by the anthems of Azerbaijan and FIDE.\nThereafter, the Head of the organising committee and the First Deputy Prime Minister of Azerbaijan Yaqub Eyyubov gave a speech.\nEyyubov spoke in Azeri and noted that the Chess Olympiad is the third-largest competition in the world.\nHe mentioned the great contribution of the president Ilham Aliyev and his father Heydar Aliyev to the sport successes of the host country, and then pointed out the great efforts that were done during the preparations for the Chess Olympiad.\nFinally, Eyyubov confidently stated that everything was ready for a well-organised and enjoyable Olympiad that he promised to be one of the most memorable in chess history.\nThe next to speak was FIDE President Kirsan Ilyumzhnov, who welcomed all participants from the record-number of countries and extolled the great preparatory work of the organising committee.\nHe also expressed his belief in the success of the Chess Olympiad on the basis of Azerbaijan's experience in hosting important chess events combined with its remarkable infrastructure and beauty.\nAfter their speeches, the President of Azerbaijan Ilham Aliyev declared the 42nd Chess Olympiad open.\nThe ceremony continued with a welcoming video that featured famous chess players from around the world addressing the participants.\nThen, there was a performance focusing of the connection between people and chess players, which included a waltz choreography as the centrepiece of the show.\nIt was followed by a graphical show at the elevated chessboard that combined folk and modern dance, and was supported by video art projected on the area around and behind the stage.\nThe show featured traditional carpet patterns and designs, embracing a dance group replaying the game of chaturanga.\nThe next part of the ceremony was the parade of nations with the presentation of flags.\nEach appearance of a new flag on the screen was accompanied by a percussionist who showed up on the stage playing on nagara with the same flag as his drumhead.\nThe percussionists left the stage under the sound of an adaption of the song \"We Are the World\".\nThe final part of the ceremony was marked with the drawing of lots.\nIt was assisted by Vladimir Kramnik and Hou Yifan as the highest-rated players of the highest-ranked teams in the open and women's event, respectively, who joined the Chief Arbiter Faiq Hasanov for the drawing of colours.\nThe draw resulted in Hou picking the White pieces, meaning that all players in the women's section with odd board numbers (1 or 3) will be White in the first round; and Kramnik picking the Black pieces, meaning that all players in the open section with odd board numbers (1 or 3) will have the Black pieces in the opening round.\nThe opening ceremony ended with a song that was specially composed for the Chess Olympiad and was performed by popular Azerbaijani singers.\nThe number of registered teams set a record of 180 teams representing 175 countries, however 10 of these did not arrive so the actual participation was 170 teams.\nThe women's event was contested by 142 teams from 138 countries, leaving 38 teams from 37 countries participating in the open event only.\nTen FIDE Member Federations did not have teams at the Olympiad.\nThey include the triple champions (2006, 2008 and 2012) in the open event Armenia as well as Bhutan, Burundi, Cambodia, Comoros, Gabon, Laos, Nauru, Solomon Islands and East Timor.\nThe Netherlands Antilles, albeit a non-existing entity since 2010, were allowed to field teams under this name, because the Cura\u00e7ao Chess Federation remains officially registered as representing the dissolved country in the FIDE Directory.\nEritrea, Kosovo, and South Sudan debuted at the Chess Olympiads.\nCountries that had teams in the women's event for the first time were: Djibouti, Guam, Guyana, Maldives, Sierra Leone and Tanzania.\nThe tournament was played in a Swiss system format.\nThe time control for all games was 90 minutes per 40 moves with additional 30 minutes after the 40th move, while the increment was 30 seconds per move.\nIt was allowed for a player to offer a draw at any time during the game.\nA total of 11 rounds were played, in which every team played with four of their players against another team.\nEvery team was allowed to nominate one reserve player.\nTeams were ranked according to the match points won in every round.\nIn case of same number of match points by two or more teams, the tie-breaker was decided by applying: 1.\nThe Sonneborn-Berger system; 2.\nTotal game points scored; 3.\nSum of the match points of the opponents, excluding the lowest one.\nThe opening ceremony of the Chess Olympiad took place at 18:30 AZST () on 1 September and the closing ceremony took place at 19:30 AZST (UTC+5) on 13 September.\nTournament rounds started on 2 September and ended with the final round on 13 September.\nAll rounds started at 15:00 AZST (UTC+5), except for the final round which started at 11:00 AZST (UTC+5).\nThere was one rest day at the tournament, on 7 September after the fifth round.\nIn addition, the Captains' meeting took place at 20:30 AZST (UTC+5) on 1 September, and the Arbiters meeting at 10:00 AZST (UTC+5) on 2 September.\nThe open section of the tournament was contested by a record number of 180 teams representing 175 nations.\nAzerbaijan, as host nation, fielded three teams, whilst the International Braille Chess Association (IBCA), the International Physically Disabled Chess Association (IPCA), and the International Chess Committee of the Deaf (ICCD) each provided one team.\nThe tournament featured eight out of the top ten players from the FIDE rating list published in August 2016; only former World Champion Vishwanathan Anand and Levon Aronian were missing the Olympiad.\nAmong the players who were playing in the open section were the World Champion and highest rated player in the world Magnus Carlsen, the challenger in the World Chess Championship 2016 Sergey Karjakin as well as the former World Champions Vladimir Kramnik and Veselin Topalov.\nGrandmaster Eugenio Torre was in the line-up of the Philippines for the record twenty-third time, having played on each Chess Olympiad since 1970 except in Dresden in 2008.\nOn the other hand, Ukraine were weaker for missing Vassily Ivanchuk, who did not play for the first time after 14 consecutive Olympiads (1988\u20132014) and 13 appearances on board one (1990\u20132014).\nThe former World Champion Challenger and leader of the Israeli team in 8 consecutive Olympiads (2000\u20132014) Boris Gelfand was also missing the Olympiad following a conflict with the Israeli Chess Federation management.\nThe strongest team of the tournament was Russia, with an average rating of 2760.\nCaptained by the president of the Russian Chess Federation and FIDE Vice President Andrey Filatov, the team consisted of the World Champion Challenger Sergey Karjakin, Vladimir Kramnik, Alexander Grischuk, Evgeny Tomashevsky and Ian Nepomniachtchi.\nEight-time Russian Champion and the fourth highest ranked Russian player Peter Svidler was not included in the team.\nThe United States were the second strongest team with three top ten players, Fabiano Caruana, Hikaru Nakamura and Wesley So, along with Samuel Shankland and Ray Robson.\nSo and Shankland had proven prior to the Olympiad that they were in good form after winning the Sinquefield Cup 2016 and the Biel Chess Festival 2016, respectively.\nThe defending champions China was the third-ranking team, and the only team besides Russia whose all players have ratings higher than 2700.\nThey participated with the same line-up that won the gold medal except for Ni Hua who was replaced by Li Chao.\nThe first team of the three that represented the host country Azerbaijan was the fourth strongest and completed the group with an average rating exceeding 2700 points.\nThe only change in their line-up from the previous Chess Olympiad was Arkadij Naiditsch, a board one player for Germany in four previous Olympiads, who replaced Gadir Guseinov.\nThe United States won the gold medal in the Open event for the first time since 1976, and for the sixth time overall.\nThey scored nine wins and two draws for a total of 20 match points, and thereby finished as one of only two teams that remained unbeaten in the open event (the other being Greece).\nUkraine scored 20 match points (ten wins and one loss) as well, but lost the tie-breaker, to secure the silver medal.\nRussia, favourites before the tournament, finished in third place with 18 match points, winning the bronze medals.\nChina, the defending champions, scored 15 match points, and occupied the 13th place in the final standings.\nNorway, led by the world champion Magnus Carlsen, ended the tournament in fifth place, which is their best result ever at the Chess Olympiads; they had only finished in the top 20 on one previous occasion.\nTeams that had a disappointing result other than China include Azerbaijan (the fourth seed) in 12th place, Spain in 31st place, the Netherlands in 36th place, and Germany in 37th place.\nAndrei Volokitin of Ukraine, playing as a reserve player, won the individual gold medal overall, scoring 8 out of 9 (eight wins and a draw) with a rating performance of 2992.\nThe other gold medalists include: Baadur Jobava of Georgia on board one with a total score of 8 out of 10 and a rating performance of 2926, Vladimir Kramnik of Russia on board two who scored 6 out of 8 with a rating performance of 2903, Wesley So of the United States on board three with 8 out of 10 and a rating performance of 2896, and Laurent Fressinet of France who scored 7 out of 8 with a rating performance of 2809.\nHowever, the best point scorer in the Open section was 64-year old Eugenio Torre who played in his record 23rd Olympiad, and scored 10 out of 11 with a rating performance of 2836 and the bronze medal on board three.\nPeter Svidler called his achievement \"frankly beyond belief\" and said of him:\nI wanted to speak a little about people who impressed the most, and somehow I kept on ignoring his performances in my previous two banters during this Olympiad, which is ridiculous, but I think pride of place goes to Eugenio Torre.\nYou probably know who he is, and you probably have read about his results by now, but what he achieved during this Olympiad is absolutely tremendous.\nHe is by no means a young man by now and he\u00a0... played a tremendous level of opposition.\nThe Philippines are a decently strong team and they played very, very decent opposition almost throughout the tournament.\nThe result Eugenio showed in this event is absolutely fantastic.\nAll board prizes were given out according to performance ratings for players who have played at least eight games at the tournament.\nAndrei Volokitin as a reserve player had the best performance of all players in the tournament:\nThe Women's event was contested a record number of 142 teams representing 138 nations.\nAzerbaijan, as host nation, fielded three teams, whilst the International Physically Disabled Chess Association (IPCA) and the International Chess Committee of the Deaf (ICCD) each provided one team.\nEight of the top ten players from the FIDE women's rating list published in August 2016 were playing in the women's event with only India's Humpy Koneru and Russia's Kateryna Lagno not playing.\nThe current Women's World Champion and highest rated woman Hou Yifan was playing on board one for China, while former Women's World Champions Antoaneta Stefanova, Alexandra Kosteniuk, Anna Ushenina and Mariya Muzychuk were also part of their national teams.\nThe top seed in the women's event were China with an average rating of 2528.\nThey were led by the Women's World Champion Hou Yifan on board one, along with Zhao Xue, Ju Wenjun, Tan Zhongyi and Guo Qi.\nThe reigning champions Russia have the second highest average rating.\nThey were led by Alexandra Kosteniuk and were playing with the same players as in the previous Olympiad, where the only difference was the induction of Aleksandra Goryachkina instead of the absent Kateryna Lagno.\nUkraine and Georgia were the other two teams with average rating higher than 2400.\nThe Ukrainian team consisted of most Grandmasters (four) and Women's World Champions (two), and included both Anna and Mariya Muzychuk playing on the top two boards, Anna Ushenina, Natalia Zhukova and Inna Gaponenko.\nGeorgia were led by the best individual player in the women's event of the Chess Olympiad in Troms\u00f8 in 2014 Nana Dzagnidze, and also had Lela Javakhishvili, Nino Batsiashvili, Bela Khotenashvili and Salome Melia on the team.\nChina won their fifth gold medal in the women's event and the first since 2004 after winning the silver medal in the last three Olympiads.\nThey scored 20 match points with nine wins and two draws, finishing three points ahead of Poland and Ukraine who scored 17 match points each.\nPoland won the silver medal after winning the tie-breaker with Ukraine.\nThe defending champions from the previous three Olympiads Russia finished without a medal on the fourth place after losing the decisive match for the gold medal against China in the final round.\nVietnam, Azerbaijan and Israel have all surprised positively, finishing on the seventh, eighth and the ninth place, respectively.\nThe teams that disappointed with their place in the final standings include Georgia, Bulgaria, Hungary, Romania, Germany, Spain and Turkey.\nValentina Gunina of Russia, playing on board two, won the individual gold medal overall with a score of 8 out of 10 (seven wins, one loss and two draws) and a rating performance of 2643.\nOn the other boards, the gold medals were won by Anna Muzychuk of Ukraine on board one with 7 out of 10 and a rating performance of 2629, Gulnar Mammadova of Azerbaijan on board three who scored 7 out of 9 with a rating performance of 2559, Tan Zhongyi of China on board four with 9 out of 11 and a rating performance of 2505, and Guo Qi of China as a reserve player who scored 5 out of 8 with a rating performance of 2394.\nAll board prizes were given out according to performance ratings for players who have played at least eight games at the tournament.\nValentina Gunina on the second board had the best performance of all players in the tournament:\nThe Nona Gaprindashvili Trophy, created by FIDE in 1997 and named after the former women's World Champion (1961\u201378), was awarded to Ukraine, having scored the highest total number of match points in the open and women's events combined.\nThe 87th FIDE Congress took place during the Olympiad, specifically from 4 to 14 September; the General Assembly was held from 11 to 13 September 2016.\nDuring the meetings held from 6 to 8 September 2016, the FIDE Ethics Commission made a decision to suspend members of the former leadership of the European Chess Union, including the former ECU President Silvio Danailov, former ECU General Secretary Sava Stoisavljevi\u0107 and former ECU Executive Director Vladimir \u0160akoti\u0107 from holding any office or position within FIDE, from participating in any meeting of FIDE as delegate or another capacity, as well as representing any organisation in its relations with FIDE for 18 months, 6 months and 3 years, respectively.\nThe suspension, however, does not preclude Danailov from exercising his duty as president of the Bulgarian Chess Federation internally.\nThey were all found guilty for violating certain clauses of the FIDE's Code of Ethics.\nIn relation with the ECU's former leadership, there are criminal charges by special prosecutor against \u0160akoti\u0107 in Montenegro as well as against the former president of the Serbian Chess Federation Miroslav Kopanja in Serbia and an investigation against the former Croatian Chess Federation leadership in Croatia.\nThe European Chess Union also voted 37\u201311 to suspend the membership of the Bulgarian Chess Federation.\nThe official logo for the 42nd Chess Olympiad was revealed during the closing ceremony of the Chess World Cup 2015 held in Baku on 5 October 2015.\nIt depicts the Baku Crystal Hall has with its unusual architecture in the shape of the so-called \"Baku Crystal\", which is a crystal shining during the night.\nThe official mascot was revealed on a press-conference dedicated to 100 days before the Chess Olympiad held in Baku on 25 May 2016.\nThe name of the mascot is \"Chess Mate\" and it represents a boy clad in a national dress.\nThe author of the mascot is Musa Changiev, whose suggestion was selected out of 600 received in the national competition launched by the Baku Chess Olympiad Operating Committee in March 2016.\nChangiev explained that he started working on the mascot once he collected some information about the game and tried to \"create an image of someone energetic and fond of thinking\".\nHe came up with the image of a young chess player with black hair and brows that are typical for the Azerbaijani people.\nThe youngster wears glasses and is clad in a combination of national and modern features.\nChangiev added that the king's gown in which the youngster is worn symbolises the King as an important chess piece as well as the kings in the history of Azerbaijan.\nThe gown is decorated with some Buta images and carpet patterns, which are traditional for the host country.\nThe youngster's shirt, trousers and shoes are the modern features.\nThe organisers of the 42nd Chess Olympiad have signed cooperation agreement with the following companies:\nThere were multiple side events that took place in order to promote the Chess Olympiad and the game of chess such as the operation of chess buses, 3D street art on chess topics, display of painted chess pieces, Chess Queen street performances, chess photography exhibitions, and parallel chess tournaments.\nIn August 2016, the Baku Chess Olympiad Operating Committee branded two double-decker buses of the Ministry of Culture and Tourism to operate in the city in the run-up and during the Olympiad.\nThey were officially launched in late August with a ceremony during which members of the Azerbaijani national team were playing chess inside.\nThe buses operated free of charge and took passengers to Baku's main sights.\nThe passengers have the chance to play chess inside the buses and obtain information about the Olympiad.\nThe buses ended operating on 14 September.\nThe Operating Committee invited the famous Ukrainian 3D street artist Alex Maksiov to create a 3D image dedicated to the 42nd Chess Olympiad.\nMaksiov was working on the image outdoors in the vicinity of the Baku Puppet Theatre on the Baku Boulevard from 24 to 27 July 2016.\nThe image depicts the Crystal Hall as he venue for the Olympiad and a chess board, which is descending into the playing area on an American roller coaster.\nAt the launch ceremony, Maksiov said that his idea was to express that the attention of the whole world will be focused on the Crystal Hall.\nIn addition, visitors could participate in solving chess problems at the National Flag Square from 1 August to 14 September.\nAt the Baku Boulevard, three giant chess sets were available to the visitors from 10 August to 14 September, while one-metre high painted chess pieces made by 30 professional artists were being displayed from 20 August to 14 September.\nThe Baku Boulevard also hosted Chess Queen dances and performances from 1 to 14 September.\nThe Queen as a chess piece symbolises freedom of movement.\nThe role of the Queens is played by acclaimed artists that performed dances as well as greet and entertain the visitors.\nThe programme of the Chess Olympiad also includes parallel tournaments that took place at the Crystal Hall from 1 to 14 September.\nThey included a children's tournament (2\u20134 September), a rapid amateurs' tournament (5\u20136 September), a rapid journalists' tournament (7 September), a rapid side tournament for chess players (8\u20139 September) and a blitz tournament (12 September).\nAll tournaments started at 15:30 AZST (UTC+5) on each day, except for the journalists' tournament on 7 September that started at 11:00 AZST (UTC+5).\nMindful particularly of the cheating incident of S\u00e9bastien Feller at the 39th Chess Olympiad (2010), combined with the general increase of cheating incidents, the World Chess Federation (FIDE) strove to have greatly enhanced security in Baku.\nSome of these were already introduced at the Chess World Cup 2015 (also in Baku), which included transmission delay of (some) games, random security checks of players, ban for bringing pens and watches into the playing hall and installment of electronic checkpoints for players at the entrance of the playing hall (see below).\nIn an interview during the preparations (May) for the Olympiad, Israel Gelfer (the Chairman of FIDE's Anti-cheating Committee) said that the issue of anti-cheating became important in the last couple of years, with the development of telecommunication technologies (mobile phones, watches and even glasses) that have caused a problem which cannot be ignored.\nGelfer explained that they are trying to balance between their will to fight against cheaters and at the same time not to create an unhealthy atmosphere in the chess world.\nThe usual electronic scans before and after the game were of course prescribed, while novel procedures included: having a special anti-cheating arbiter (Klaus Deventer) with approximately 15 arbiters under his authority, one of whose charges was to carry out 30\u201340 checks during the round; and that players must inform their Match Arbiter when leaving the playing area.\nDespite the aforementioned anti-cheating protocols, some participants felt that this was merely a display without effect.\nMobile phones were commonly heard going off, particularly in the entourage of FIDE President Kirsan Ilyumzhinov.\nIt was also regarded as fairly easy to circumvent the initial metal detectors simply by passing an object around them.\nIn the fourth round, a Japanese player (Tang Tang) was forfeited after he was caught with an electronic device in a random check conducted prior to leaving the venue.\nThe game result was reversed from a win for the player to a loss, which also resulted in a change in the match score.\nChief Arbiter Faiq Hasanov said that he was approached by an arbiter in the anti-cheating department and informed about the matter.\nHe himself did not bother to check if there was a chess program installed on the device, as possession already violated the rules, leading to an automatic forfeiture.\nLater information from other arbiters involved indicated there possibly were two devices involved, and their quick check did not indicate a chess program was running.\nWithout sufficient evidence of cheating \"per se\", Hasanov felt that more than game disqualification would be double punishment.\nThe captain of the Japanese team GM Mihajlo Stojanovi\u0107 later addressed some of the related issues in comments on the blog of the Macedonian grandmaster and general secretary of the Association of Chess Professionals Aleksandar \u010coloovi\u1e31.\nDuring the game of the seventh round between Nigel Short and Li Chao, the former was returning from the toilet with about 30 minutes to make 20 moves when an anti-cheating arbiter asked him to undergo a spot check with a hand scanner for electronic devices.\nShort did not heed the request, and sat back down to play.\nAfter the game, Klaus Deventer (the head of the anti-cheating arbiters) reprimanded Short with a warning.\nShort discussed the incident extensively after the event, indicating that he did not think the cost of annoyance to the player (even when returning from outside the playing area) was comparable to the anti-cheating benefit, though he was not pressed specifically regarding cases where a culprit had in fact been disqualified following mid-game requests for inspection (some for refusal, others for being caught with a device).\nInitially Short also mentioned the fact that he and the arbiter in question (Jamie Kenmure, an Australian who is FIDE delegate for the Solomon Islands) have a political past, and thus Short did not trust that his being selected for the test actually originated from Deventer (as per the regulations).\nAlternative initial reports dramatised the event to have the arbiters \"ask[ing] him to step away from the board and subject himself to a full search\" while in time trouble and playing a \"do-or-die\" position, though these details now seem discredited.\nA significant petition was circulated by Jonathan Speelman and others regarding the mandatory notification of the arbiter when leaving the playing area (the petition concentrated on toilet visits).\nReasons given for this protesting against this \"noxious\" rule included: the FIDE rule that the toilet is part of the playing area; an indication it was \"humiliating\" for players to discuss bodily functions with arbiters (and embarrassing for the arbiters); a note that the Match Arbiter (the indicated person to be notified) was not always available, rendering it difficult to always comply with the rule; an argument that frequent toilet trips did not indicate cheating, and a request that players not be penalised merely for this; and an argument that the opponent might gain information from seeing a player notify the arbiter by moving as soon as they left for the bathroom visit.\nThe response by Chief Arbiter Faiq Hasanov noted only that the third complaint was legitimate, and that \"common sense\" should apply.\nMultiple post-event comments by captains and players continued to report the annoyance of the anti-cheating measures, noting that a better balance between security and enjoyment could be found by FIDE.\nBaadur Jobava was prominent on the other side of the issue, opining that the anti-cheating measures would help solve the non-stop screaming about this great \"headache\" for the 21st century chess player.\nDue to a small number of embassies, Azerbaijan can be more difficult to obtain a visa when compared to other countries which have hosted the Olympiad.\nThis issue was briefly raised during the 83rd FIDE Congress, and Azad Rahimov noted the country had a positive experience with the Eurovision Song Contest 2012, where all participants could receive a visa on arrival at the airport without any problem.\nIn a similar manner, in April 2016, the President of Azerbaijan Ilham Aliyev signed an order on simplifying the visa procedures for travellers to Azerbaijan in connection with the Chess Olympiad, allowing them to get visas in the country's international airports.\nA number of African nations did not show up in time, for various reasons such as difficulties flying through Istanbul, and finalisation of monetary arrangements (teams must pay first, and then get reimbursed later).\nFormer Kenyan Olympic participant and owner of the website Kenya Chess Masala said that the issue just paints Africa in bad image.\nOn 5 September, the organisers confirmed at a press-conference that the host-nation was ready to pay for the poorer nations to travel.\nBhari confirmed that the travel expenses were the main problem and wrote that 116 out of the planned 187 federations were on a travel subsidy, including his native Kenya whose players had not shown in the first rounds, though.\nHe also explained that one of the biggest issues was the timing of the funding and that the teams were expected to pay on their own and be reimbursed upon arrival.\nFinally, Bhari had already reminded other federations to start planning their travel expenses for the 43rd Chess Olympiad in Batumi in 2018.\nIn the end, 10 African nations did not arrive (Kenya, Cameroon, Mali, Rwanda, Sierra Leone, Burundi, Liberia, Seychelles, Senegal, Central African Republic).\nArmenia's participation in a Chess Olympiad hosted in Azerbaijan was raised as a concern at the 83rd FIDE Congress in Istanbul in 2012 during discussions about Baku's nomination to host the Olympiad in 2016, with the Armenian representative protesting since Armenian chess players would find it quite difficult to play in Baku.\nHistorically this is nothing new, as the tense relations between Armenia and Azerbaijan because of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict have been mirrored in chess over the years, resulting in the absence of players from one of the two countries at tournaments hosted in the other country and even relocation of chess events.\nFor example, the candidates tournament for the World Chess Championship 2012 was ultimately moved (completely) from Baku to Kazan, with consideration given that one underlying reason was because Armenia's Levon Aronian was inhospitable toward playing in Azerbaijan.\nMore recently, Azerbaijan chose not to play in the 2015 World Team Chess Championship in Tsaghkadzor, and Azerbaijani players did not participate in the European Individual Chess Championship 2014 in Yerevan.\nNevertheless, Armenian players, including Levon Aronian, did play at the 2015 Chess World Cup in Baku, giving some hope the team would appear at the Olympiad.\nIn May 2016, during his visit to Yerevan, FIDE President Kirsan Ilyumzhinov said that, after talking to the Armenian Chess Federation chairman Serzh Sargsyan (also President of Armenia), he heard no refusal about their participation.\nThe vice-president of the Armenian Chess Federation Smbat Lputian responded that Armenia was still discussing the matter and had not decided on the matter yet.\nIn July 2016, Lputian announced that (based upon discussion within the federation) the Armenian chess team would not participate in the Chess Olympiad.\nIsrael participated without Boris Gelfand, Emil Sutovsky, and Ilya Smirin due to a dispute with the Israel Chess Federation management.\nThe hardships were already evident in 2015, when the country failed to send a team at the European Team Chess Championship due to monetary difficulties.\nBoris Gelfand, who played on board one for Israel at nine consecutive Olympiads (1998\u20132014), said the management of the Israel Chess Federation have \"absolutely forgotten about such things as the prestige of the country\".\nEmil Sutovsky claimed on his Facebook page that the dispute was about \"showing who's boss rather than money\".\nBulgaria played without Ivan Cheparinov and Kiril Georgiev, the former due to monetary disputes, and the latter because the Bulgarian Chess Federation considered him banned.\nAt one point, the entire Bulgarian team was rumored not to be coming (similarly they were absent from the 2015 European Team Chess Championship), as was Greece.\nOne week before the Olympiad started, the Pakistani Sports Board, dealing with three separate claimants to status of official national federation, refused to issue \"No Objection Certificates\" (NOCs).\nA spokesman said, \"we have refused to issue NOCs to around 15 men and women chess players and two officials as currently no chess federation is recognised by us.\nIssuing them NOCs will mean we've accepted an illegal body.\"\nIn the end, a team from Pakistan (with its top players) did attend and finished slightly above average.\nKenya has had a long running dispute within its federation, and due to this and other reasons the open team ended up not showing up for the event and the women's team began play only in round 5."}

Porter is \"reactivated\" following the kidnap of journalist Katie Dartmouth (Orla Brady) by the same terrorists he fought seven years previous, including the same boy, As'ad.\nPorter succeeds in rescuing Dartmouth and joins Section 20, headed by Hugh Collinson (Andrew Lincoln), who was also present during the fateful mission.\nBy the end of the series, it is revealed that Collinson was the one who killed the soldiers, and covered this up.\nSection 20 officer Layla Thompson (Jodhi May) discovers this, and blackmails Collinson into saving Porter's life in Afghanistan.\nThere, Porter learns that during the mission, Collinson panicked and mistook the soldiers for terrorists.\nTaliban members raid their location, and Collinson is mortally wounded while aiding Porter's

destruction originally used to plant in Iraq, which serves as a part of Project Dawn.\nThe weapon, namely VX nerve gas was kept in storage, and Latif has known about its existence.\nSection 20's worldwide search for Latif ends in Budapest, Hungary, where they learn he is using suicide bombers by implanting them with explosive devices inside their bodies, which in turn will release the VX.\nThe attempted attacks against a World Summit were actually a diversion to capture former Pakistani general Akmal Ramiz (Silas Carson), who Latif fears will make Pakistan more accessible to the west.\nHe also captures Section 20 head Colonel Eleanor Grant (Amanda Mealing) in an attempt to confess to \"Operation Trojan Horse\", which planned to plant VX in Iraq, while also exposing Porter and framing Scott; Grant attempted to cover up the operation in shame.\nIn the end, Grant forces Latif to shoot an empty VX canister, with the explosives still intact, killing them both.\nAlthough Scott gains the file that would clear his name, he decides to burn the file and remain in Section 20.\nMeanwhile, Stonebridge decides to leave to be with his pregnant wife.\nFormer military intelligence operative, Major Rachel Dalton (Rhona Mitra) takes charge of Section 20.\nThey work throughout Africa to get their hands on four nuclear triggers which are in the wrong hands after a mission in Somalia.\nThe triggers have originally been sold to Conrad Knox (Charles Dance), an English billionaire and philanthropist based in South Africa, who runs the Knox Foundation, charged with disarming unstable regions.\nHowever, it becomes apparent that he is using the weapons to arm his own militia and is using the triggers to build nuclear weapons with the intent of liberating Africa \"to a point where its voice is not just heard but listened to.\"\nDue to Knox's influence, Section 20 is forced to go dark to stop him.\nIn the meantime, Stonebridge seeks revenge on Craig Hanson (Shane Taylor) for murdering his wife and returns to Section 20, while Scott has to contend with Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) agent Christy Bryant (Stephanie Vogt), with whom he used to work contract

name=\"brady/armitage sky\"></ref> Armitage describes the character as \"sort of like Lucas North [the character he played on the BBC espionage series \"Spooks\"], only on some kind of go-faster drug.\"\nFollowing the announcement of the second series, Armitage had to drop out of the role, following his commitment to appear as Thorin Oakenshield in \"The Hobbit\" films.\nHe was replaced by Sullivan Stapleton, who plays former United States Delta force operative Damian Scott, and Philip Winchester who plays Michael Stonebridge.\nStapleton was originally contracted to appear in two series.\nIn the first series, Andrew Lincoln plays Hugh Collinson, Porter's comrade in the 2003 mission and Section 20 boss.\nJodhi May plays Lieutenant Layla Thompson, an \"ambitious woman working in a male-dominated field that she's climbed to the top of\".\nOver the course of the first series she grows to distrust Collinson.\nShelley Conn plays Sergeant Danni Prendiville, a Section 20 officer who has an affair with Porter.\nColin Salmon appears as civil servant James Middleton, and Orla Brady plays kidnapped Sky war correspondent Katie Dartmouth.\nFollowing Collinson's demise, Amanda

SAS soldier who was known as the only member of his unit, Bravo Two Zero, to evade capture by Iraqi forces during the Gulf War in 1991, and was regarded as the most difficult escape for a British soldier.\nRyan became a novelist after leaving the SAS.\nAndy Harries, the chief executive of his production company, Left Bank Pictures, saw the novel \"Strike Back\" at an airport while on holiday, but never got around to reading it.\nRegardless, he still managed to pitch the idea of a series from the novel to Sky's Head of Drama Elaine Pyke, who commissioned it.\nHarries said of the experience, \"I read the back of the book just to remind myself, I remember Elaine saying 'what's the story' and I said 'Don't worry about that, it's really the thrust of the piece.'\"\nThe commission became part of Sky's \u00a310 million commitment to producing original dramas based on novels following the network's success in adapting the \"Discworld\" novels from Terry Pratchett.\nIt was also a part of Sky's attempt to replicate the pace of American-based action series including \"24\".\nChris Ryan became involved in the project by acting as a series consultant and script advisor.\nHarries also served as a producer on the show.\nA second series of \"Strike Back\" was commissioned by Sky in August 2010, for a longer run of 10 episodes.\nLater, in February 2011, it was announced that Sky entered an international co-production deal with the American television network Cinemax, as the network wanted to introduce a new original drama series.\nThe first episodes of the series was written by \"The X-Files\" alum Frank Spotnitz.\nSpotnitz was brought in to start the second series with the purpose to re-imagine the show, as the producers needed it to work in the absence of first series lead Richard Armitage, due to the actor's commitment to \"The Hobbit\" film series in New Zealand.\nIn the first series, Armitage had to \"bulk up for the role.\"\nThe actor spent ten weeks with a trainer in the UK, before moving to Johannesburg, where the first series was shot, and participated in more training, however he had to spend ten days after arriving to acclimatise to the city's high altitudes.\nBefore the second series, more main cast members took up intensive bootcamp style training in South Africa by former SAS and SBS operators.\nThe two leads Stapleton and Winchester underwent the most intensive training.\nThe actors were trained in many aspects including running, teamwork, tactical manoeuvres with and without weapons and other various military tactics.\nWinchester recalled his training experience, \"[Sullivan Stapleton] and I would meet every morning at 6am.\nWe would run to a chosen location and on the way we had to memorise street names and directions and then our trainers would say 'that car that you just passed what was the licence plate number?'\nOur trainers were ex-SAS guys who made us study everything in detail, for example, we learnt step by step how to enter a room in twos, then alone.\nAt the same time, we had to be constantly aware of where our weapon was trained.\"\nThe series uses a vast array of firearms and other weapons, including side arms, assault and sniper rifles, rocket-propelled grenades, hand grenades and other explosives as well as knives and other weapons.\nIn training, cast members started by carrying weights that mimicked the weapons so they could get used to carrying them during filming.\nThey were later taught how to handle various firearms used in the series to make it appear as real as possible, they were taught to disassemble and re-assemble, fire and reload the weapons used before scenes/shooting.\nFormer SAS and SBS servicemen gave many of the cast weapons training, and were also on hand during the filming to oversee and advise the cast members on the proper handling and use of the various weapons and tactics used in different scenes.\nFilming the first series began in South Africa in August 2009, and was shot with 35mm film.\n35mm cameras were used because the crew regard them as \"the best and most flexible capture medium\" available.\nThree Kodak film stocks were used for filming the series, along with a variety of Arri cameras.\nEach scene uses a minimum of two cameras, but the crew regularly use four camera angles.\nHaving worked in South Africa several times in the past, decided to use the country as the filming location for the series, as he felt it could replicate anywhere in the world.\nThe first series was largely filmed in the Gauteng province, including its capital, Johannesburg.\nLocal crew members were used to collaborate with the British crew.\nStarting with \"Project Dawn\", Cape Town was largely used as a filming location, with other episodes filmed in Durban and Springbok, Northern Cape.\nBefore filming \"Project Dawn\", the production crew were scouting other filming locations throughout Europe, South America and the United States.\nThe series would additionally be shot in Budapest, Hungary.\nSome other scenes were also shot in the UK.\nThe first two episodes of \"Vengeance\" were originally scheduled to film in Mozambique, but a week before filming was due to start the country had \"a massive freedom fighter rally.\"\nThe series aired on Sky One in the United Kingdom.\nThe first series began airing on 5 May

One\" in the country, it began airing on Cinemax on 12 August 2011.\nThe premiere attracted 567,000 viewers on its first telecast, and an additional 500,000 viewed the two following encores.\nDespite the limited availability of the network on American television (only 16.7 million homes have Cinemax available), it was the best ratings performance for the network since a broadcast of the film \"Titanic\" in 2005.\n\"Vengeance\" premiered with two back-to-back episodes, on 17 August 2012.\nIt attracted 390,000 viewers, with encores increasing viewership to over half a

Ilsley Erected 1905\".\nNeither the sculptures nor the base are signed by the artists.\nThe sculpture is made of a light, fine grained medium Barre granite from the Jones Brothers company's quarry.\nIt measures approximately 32 feet 1 inch high, with the base measuring approximately 2 feet 8 inches x 17 feet 6 inches x 17 feet 6 inches.\nThe sculpture has also been referred to as the Soldier's Monument, the Civil War Monument, the Ilsley Monument, and the Spanish American Monument.\nThe sculpture sits over a fire protection cistern which had been made obsolete after a water system had been installed in the village in 1902.\nThe sculpture was commissioned by Silas A. Ilsley (13 March 1840 \u2013 9 January 1918) on 18 November 1904.\nIlsley had served in the New York infantry during the Civil War and moved to Middlebury in 1901 following his retirement from the tinware business in Brooklyn, NY.\nHe donated the monument to the town of Middlebury and the sculpture was dedicated 30 May 1905.\nThe celebration of the dedication was reportedly attended by 7,000 people and included speeches, a parade, and fireworks.\nMarshall Jones and Seward Jones designed the sculpture which was fabricated by the Jones Brothers Company, founded in Boston, MA in 1882 and began operations in Barre, VT in 1886.\nThe company's granite shed, now the home of the Vermont Granite Museum, is considered significant by the Vermont Division for Historic Preservation and was named one of \"America's Treasures\" by the United States Department of the Interior.\nThis sculpture was documented as needing conservation treatment in 1992 as part of Save Outdoor Sculpture!, a campaign organized by Heritage Preservation: The National Institute of Conservation in partnership with the Smithsonian Institution, specifically the Smithsonian American Art Museum.\nThroughout the 1990s, over 7,000 volunteers cataloged and assessed the condition of over 30,000 publicly accessible statues, monuments, and sculptures installed as outdoor public art across the United States.\nIn Vermont, the survey was sponsored by the Vermont Museum and Gallery Alliance from 1992-1993 where 110 volunteers surveyed 242 sculptures dating from 1740 to 1993.\nThe archives from the project are maintained by the Vermont Historical Society."}

1218)\n\u00c1lvaro N\u00fa\u00f1ez de Lara ( 11701218) was a Castilian nobleman who played a key role, along with other members of the House of Lara, in the political and military affairs of the Kingdoms of Le\u00f3n and Castile around the turn of the 13th century.\nHe was made a count in 1214, served as \"alf\u00e9rez\" to King Alfonso VIII of Castile, was the regent during the minority of King Henry I of Castile, and was \"mayordomo\" (steward) to King Alfonso IX of Le\u00f3n.\nHe opposed Queen Berengaria of Castile and her son King Ferdinand III and supported the King of Le\u00f3n during the war between the two countries of 1217\u20131218.\nAt the end of his life he was a knight of the Order of Santiago, in whose Monastery of Ucl\u00e9s he was buried.\nHis parents both came from powerful houses with close connections to the Leonese royalty.\nHis father, Count Nu\u00f1o P\u00e9rez de Lara, was regent during the minority of Alfonso VIII of Castile, and son of Count Pedro Gonz\u00e1lez de Lara, the one-time lover of Queen Urraca.\nHis mother, Teresa Fern\u00e1ndez de Traba, was a member of the Galician House of Traba and half-sister of King Afonso I of Portugal, their shared mother being Teresa of Le\u00f3n, Countess of Portugal, Urraca's half-sister.\nWhen Count Nu\u00f1o died in 1177, Teresa married King Ferdinand II of Le\u00f3n, who thus became the stepfather of her children, who were then raised at court along with the future King of Le\u00f3n, Alfonso IX.\nHis brothers Fernando and Gonzalo were also counts and significant figures in the political and military affairs of the era.\nFernando was \"alf\u00e9rez\" to King Alfonso VIII.\nNonetheless, his outsized ambition put him at odds with the king and he had to leave Castile and seek refuge in Marrakech, where he died in 1220 The career of the other brother, Gonzalo, father of count Nu\u00f1o Gonz\u00e1lez de Lara \"\"el Bueno\"\", played out in the Kingdom of Le\u00f3n.\nUpon the death of his stepfather King Ferdinand II, \u00c1lvaro established himself in the Castilian court, following his two brothers.\nFrom January 1196 he began to attest royal charters.\nIt was during this time that the Laras became close to Diego L\u00f3pez II de Haro, Lord of Biscay, and possibly around this time \u00c1lvaro married Urraca, the daughter of Diego, whom he replaced as royal \"alf\u00e9rez\" in May 1199, a post in which he served until 1201, when he handed it over to his brother Fernando, and again between 1208 and 1217.\nHe fought alongside his brothers Fernando and Gonzalo in the Battle of Las Navas de Tolosa on 16 July 1212, carrying the royal standard.\nThe \"Chronica latina regum Castellae\" provides a vivid account of the performance of Count \u00c1lvaro in the battle.\nIn gratitude for the valor demonstrated by the count in this battle, which marked a milestone of the Reconquista, Alfonso VIII granted him, on 31 October 1212, the village of Castroverde, referring to him as \"my beloved and loyal vassal (...) as reward for the many voluntary services which you have lent me and faithfully fulfilled, and as well which you have made an effort to fulfill up to this very day; and more so as reward for the service, which is to be particularly cherished, which you performed for me on the field of battle when you carried my standard like a valiant man.\"\nYears later, on 18 May 1217, \u00c1lvaro donated the village to the Order of Santiago.\n\"Infante\" Ferdinand of Le\u00f3n, son of Alfonso IX and his first wife Theresa of Portugal and heir to the throne of Le\u00f3n, died in August 1214 at the age of 22.\nBerengaria and her father King Alfonso VIII harbored the hope that \"Infante\" Ferdinand of Leon, Alfonso IX's son by his second wife, Berengaria herself, would succeed his father, although first it was necessary to arrive at an agreement with the Leonese and the Portuguese to annul the rights to the throne of the sisters of the recently deceased \"infante\", Sancha and Dulce.\nHowever a few months later, on 6 October 1214, King Alfonso VIII of Castile died and the court decided on his son Henry to succeed him on the throne.\nBefore dying, the king had charged the bishops, his friend Menc\u00eda L\u00f3pez de Haro, and his steward, Gonzalo Rodr\u00edguez Gir\u00f3n, executors of his will, with the task of seeing to the carrying out of his commands and the assurance of his succession.\nThe king's widow Eleanor ceded custody of the heir to Berengaria.\nWeeks later, Queen Eleanor died and left the guardianship of Henry and the regency to her daughter Berengaria and the prelates of Palencia and Toledo.\nSome nobles believed that Berengaria's regency was too dependent on the support of the Bishop of Palencia, Tello T\u00e9llez de Meneses, and Rodrigo Jim\u00e9nez de Rada, Archbishop of Toledo.\nThis situation annoyed them and, according to the \"Chronica latina regum Castellae\", \"a majority of the barons decided that \u00c1lvaro ought to be regent in the king's name and take charge of the care of the realm.\"\n\u00c1lvaro, according to \"De rebus Hispaniae\", bribed Garc\u00eda Lorenzo, a knight of Palencia and guardian of the young king, to hand Henry over to them.\nBerengaria conceded this reluctantly.\nGiven this fait accompli and with the consent of the barons and prelates of the kingdom, \u00c1lvaro had to swear that neither he nor his brothers or other noblemen \"... would transfer lands from or to anyone, nor would they wage war against neighboring kingdoms, nor impose tributes... under pain of conviction for high treason\".\nAs Jim\u00e9nez de Rada asserted, it was the ambition of the Laras to control the kingdom, just as \u00c1lvaro's father, Nu\u00f1o P\u00e9rez de Lara, had done while regent from 1164 to 1169 during the minority of King Alfonso VIII.\nIt was during this time that \u00c1lvaro was raised to the rank of count.\nJim\u00e9nez de Rada's \"De rebus Hispaniae\" is the main source for the events occurring in those years covered by the \"Estoria de Espa\u00f1a\".\nThe archbishop's objectivity in his recounting of events should be accepted with caution due to his sympathy for the crown, his disdain of the Laras, and his determination \"to promote the interests of Toledo over those of Santiago and Seville.\"\nDuring his years as regent, Count \u00c1lvaro fell out with the clergy and abused his position, especially in 1215 when, taking advantage of the absence of several bishops from the kingdom during the Fourth Lateran Council (1215-1216), he moved to take over their privileges and rental income and expropriated the \"tercias\" (part of the church tithes).\nNevertheless, on 15 February 1216, he apologized publicly and promised that we would never again collect these \"tercias\" nor suggest that they be expropriated.\nIn April 1216, making a show of his power, Count \u00c1lvaro signed a document in the Royal Monastery of San Benito de Sahag\u00fan in which Henry is said to reign in Toledo and Castile and \"\u00c1lvaro N\u00fa\u00f1ez to rule the whole country under him\".\nHe destabilized the political situation by excluding other noblemen from the center of power.\nA notable case was that of Gonzalo Rodr\u00edguez Gir\u00f3n, removed in 1216 from his post as high steward which he had held for eighteen years.\nOther nobles, like Lope D\u00edaz II de Haro, Lord of Biscay, \u00c1lvaro D\u00edaz de los Cameros, Alfonso T\u00e9llez de Meneses, and the Archbishop of Toledo himself were also marginalized.\nIn the spring of 1216, the count tried to convince King Alfonso IX to have his former wife, Queen Berengaria, hand over her castles.\nIt may be for this reason that Berengaria decided to send her son Ferdinand to join his father in order to ensure his succession in Le\u00f3n.\nAround this time, the Cortes were summoned a few times at the urging of some of the nobles.\nBerengaria did not attend them, either because she was not advised of them or by her own decision.\nLope D\u00edaz de Haro, Gonzalo Rodr\u00edguez Gir\u00f3n, \u00c1lvaro D\u00edaz de los Cameros, Alfonso T\u00e9llez de Meneses, and Archbishop de Rada went to Berengaria, who was in the Abbey of Las Huelgas in Burgos, to ask that she intervene and respond to the abuses being committed by \u00c1lvaro.\nShortly afterward, \u00c1lvaro moved to Medina del Campo with King Henry, and then to \u00c1vila where he was knighted.\nHe wrote to Berengaria, warning her not to act against the king's household, that is, against the court of which he was the regent.\nAround this time, he negotiated the marriage of Henry to Mafalda, daughter of King Sancho I of Portugal, a union which was later annulled at the urging of Queen Berengaria by the bishops of Burgos and Palencia in obedience of the orders of Pope Innocent III.\nLater, \u00c1lvaro negotiated with King Alfonso IX for the marriage of his daughter Sancha to Henry.\nIf the marriage (which was prevented by the death of the young king) had taken place, Henry would have become the heir to the crown of Le\u00f3n.\nIn the autumn of 1216, \u00c1lvaro, claiming to act in the name of Henry I, demanded that Berengaria hand over several castles, including those of Burgos, San Esteban de Gormaz, Curiel de Duero, Valladolid, and Hita, as well as the Cantabrian ports, all of which were part of the \"arras\" paid her by Alfonso IX on the event of their marriage.\nBerengaria sought explanations from her brother Henry, who denied being aware of such a request on the part of the regent and, alarmed by the excesses being committed by \u00c1lvaro, attempted to meet with his sister.\nWhen \u00c1lvaro learned of this, he ordered the killing of the messenger Berengaria had sent to court to determine how her brother was and to ascertain the activities of the count.\nJim\u00e9nez de Rada's chronicle tells that \u00c1lvaro forged a letter of Berengaria's, supposedly urging the assassination of King Henry according to the advice of the Meneses and Gir\u00f3n families, Tierra de Campos nobles who were openly in support of her.\nDue to the bias shown by Jim\u00e9nez de Rada and his unconditional support of Berengaria, the letter may have been authentic and not a forgery by \u00c1lvaro as the archbishop wrote.\nWhatever the case, opposition to \u00c1lvaro grew after this episode.\nRodrigo Gonz\u00e1lez de Valverde, a knight loyal to Berengaria, tried to organize a meeting between Berengaria and her brother Henry, but he was taken prisoner and brought to the Castle of Alarc\u00f3n on \u00c1lvaro's orders.\nAccording to the \"Chronica latina regum Castellae\", the year 1217 was one of great tension, \"such as never had been before in Castile\".\nThe royal high steward, Gonzalo Rodr\u00edguez Gir\u00f3n, was replaced by Mart\u00edn Mu\u00f1oz de Hinojosa.\nOther nobles allied with Berengaria, such as the Meneses, Gir\u00f3n, Haro, and Cameros families, were notably absent from royal charters.\n\u00c1lvaro also made changes to the chancery.\nThe \"alferiz et procurator regis et regni\", as he is titled in the records, succeeded in having all the castles of the kingdom handed over to him, possibly so he could install landholders and fortress captains whom he trusted.\nThis led him into conflict with a great deal of the nobility, who noticed that he was grabbing more and more power.\nThe opposition faction included the Meneses, Gir\u00f3n, Haro and Cameros families, whose absence from the Royal Council is noted from February 1217.\nIn the same month, \u00c1lvaro traveled with King Henry to Valladolid, possibly as a last-ditch effort to avoid a war.\nThe new royal high steward, Mart\u00edn Mu\u00f1oz de Hinojosa, sent a letter to Berengaria seeking the surrender of the castles of Burgos and Valladolid as well as the Cantabrian ports.\nIt seems that she handed over all of these except for Valladolid, although this did not prevent the conflict.\nBerengaria was staying at the castle of Autillo de Campos, which was controlled by the Gir\u00f3n family.\n\u00c1lvaro refused to relinquish his power.\nThe chronicles mention that the Gir\u00f3n family, Garc\u00eda Fern\u00e1ndez de Villamayor, Guill\u00e9n P\u00e9rez de Guzm\u00e1n, son-in-law of Gonzalo Rodr\u00edguez Gir\u00f3n, and Gil Manrique marched to Autillo to support Berengaria.\nLope D\u00edaz de Haro entrenched himself in Miranda de Ebro with some 300 knights.\nWhen \u00c1lvaro discovered this, he sent his brother Gonzalo, who set out with a larger army.\nThe clergy succeeded in preventing a battle, and Gonzalo returned to court while Lope D\u00edaz de Haro met up with Berengaria in Autillo.\nIn March 1217, \u00c1lvaro, accompanied by his brothers Counts Fernando and Gonzalo, Mart\u00edn Mu\u00f1oz de Hinojosa, Garc\u00eda Ord\u00f3\u00f1ez, Guillermo Gonz\u00e1lez de Mendoza, and other nobles, invaded Tierra de Campos, where the Gir\u00f3n and Meneses families held inherited lands, causing much destruction in the valley of Trigueros.\nThey then headed for the castle of Montealegre and the lands of Suero T\u00e9llez de Meneses.\nHis relatives, Gonzalo Rodr\u00edguez Gir\u00f3n and Alfonso T\u00e9llez de Meneses, came to his aid with their armed retinues, although they retreated and avoided waging battle on finding out that the young King Henry was among the regent's forces.\nAlfonso T\u00e9llez de Meneses surrendered the castle and marched to Villalba del Alcor, pursued by \u00c1lvaro's troops, where he defended the castle during a seventy-day siege without the support of the nobles who were still in Autillo.\nSubsequently, \u00c1lvaro's troops marched on Autillo and Cisneros and laid siege to Berengaria and her supporters.\nLope D\u00edaz de Haro and Gonzalo Rodr\u00edguez Gir\u00f3n headed to the court of Le\u00f3n to ask that \"Infante\" Ferdinand come in aid of his mother.\nMeanwhile, King Henry lifted the siege of Autillo as \u00c1lvaro made his way to Frechilla, laying waste to Gir\u00f3n's lands.\nBerengaria found herself forced to sue for peace, surrendering the places which were then in the power of King Henry and Count \u00c1lvaro.\nDuring \"Infante\" Ferdinand's absence from the court of Le\u00f3n, \u00c1lvaro was appointed royal high steward at the end of 1217, and Sancho, son of Queen Urraca L\u00f3pez de Haro and King Ferdinand II of Le\u00f3n, replaced him as royal \"alf\u00e9rez\".\nCount \u00c1lvaro and the court of Castile established themselves in the episcopal palace of Palencia.\nThe bishop at the time was Tello T\u00e9llez de Meneses, brother of Alfonso and Suero T\u00e9llez de Meneses and a relative of the Gir\u00f3n family.\nIn May 1217, \u00c1lvaro established himself in the episcopal palace of Palencia with the Castilian court and King Henry.\nOn 26 May, the young king suffered an accident while playing with other children in the palace courtyard when a tile which came loose from the roof fell and struck him on the head, causing a fatal injury.\nThis accident marked the beginning of \u00c1lvaro's downfall.\nHe tried to conceal the king's death and brought his body to the castle of Tariego.\nBerengaria learned of her brother's death almost immediately, probably thanks to her spies in the Leonese court.\nShe took charge of recovering her brother's body and bringing it to the family vault in the Abbey of Las Huelgas in Burgos, where he was buried.\nMeanwhile, Berengaria asked her son, the future King Ferdinand III, who was with his father King Alfonso IX in Toro, to come join her.\nShe entrusted this mission to three of her most loyal supporters, Gonzalo Rodr\u00edguez Gir\u00f3n, Alfonso T\u00e9llez de Meneses, and Lope D\u00edaz II de Haro.\nThey were to convince Alfonso that \"Infante\" Ferdinand must return to join his mother, without revealing the plans for the succession to the throne of Castile, and to accompany him to Autillo, where she was, on the pretext that the castle had been attacked, and hiding the news of the death of her brother Henry.\nAlthough the \"infantas\" Sancha and Dulce rejected the noblemen's explanations, they finally convinced them that Henry was safe and sound and succeeded in bringing \"Infante\" Ferdinand to join his mother in Autillo, where shortly afterward he was acclaimed king.\nThis was done without the approval of the court and the councils of the most important towns of Castile which met in Segovia and later in Valladolid to deal with the succession issue.\nSome preferred the fulfillment of the terms of the Treaty of Sahag\u00fan by which Alfonso IX would be proclaimed King of Castile, thereby uniting the two crowns, or otherwise that the throne should pass to Berengaria, a choice which ultimately prevailed.\nBerengaria immediately abdicated in favor of her son, who was proclaimed king on 2 July 1217 in Valladolid.\nAlthough Berengaria was the eldest of the children of Alfonso VIII of Castile, \u00c1lvaro had claimed that Blanche of Castile, queen consort of France by her marriage to Louis VIII, should succeed the recently deceased King Henry.\nHe sent her a letter to this effect, which she rejected, and she asked that \u00c1lvaro hand over the castles he offered her to her sister Berengaria.\nBerengaria and King Ferdinand moved immediately to Palencia.\nFerdinand's troops marched to Due\u00f1as where his partisans started negotiations to put an end to hostilities.\n\u00c1lvaro reproached Berengaria for the rushed coronation of Ferdinand and sought custody of him, Berengaria refused the offer, although the new king was already approaching eighteen years of age.\n\u00c1lvaro's claims were dismissed and King Ferdinand and his retinue marched to Valladolid.\nOn 4 July, two days after Ferdinand's coronation, his father, King Alfonso IX, who still had not renounced his claims to the throne of Castile, invaded the Tierra de Campos and occupied Urue\u00f1a, Villagarc\u00eda, Castromonte and Arroyo.\nMeanwhile, \"Infante\" Sancho Fern\u00e1ndez of Le\u00f3n who at the time was the royal \"alf\u00e9rez\" and tenant-in-chief of Le\u00f3n, Salamanca, and other places, invaded \u00c1vila, but was repelled by the town militia and forced to retreat.\nKing Ferdinand tried to arrive at an agreement with his father wherein he would renounce the Castilian throne.\nAlfonso IX proposed that he secure a papal dispensation in order to remarry Berengaria, recognizing her rights to the throne of Castile, and that the two kingdoms unite upon their deaths, and that they be succeeded by their son Ferdinand as the sole king.\nThe Castilians rejected this proposal and Alfonso IX set out for Burgos to take the city.\nBerengaria and her supporters sent Lope D\u00edaz II de Haro and the brothers Rodrigo and \u00c1lvaro D\u00edaz de los Cameros to protect Due\u00f1as, fearing an attack from Alfonso.\nAdvised by \u00c1lvaro, Alfonso headed toward Burgos by way of Laguna de Duero, Torquemada, and Tord\u00f3mar, laying waste along the way to the lands of Berengaria's high steward Garc\u00eda Fern\u00e1ndez de Villamayor.\nFinally he decided to return to Le\u00f3n after weighing the difficulty of taking Burgos.\nOn his way through Palencia, he laid waste to the lands of his enemies, the Gir\u00f3n and Meneses families and advanced as far as Torremormoj\u00f3n.\nMeanwhile, troops from \u00c1vila and Segovia arrived at the Castilian court, which was in Palencia, to support King Ferdinand, who had already recovered control of Burgos, Lerma, Lara, and Palenzuela, although Mu\u00f1\u00f3 remained loyal to \u00c1lvaro.\nIn the middle of August 1217, King Ferdinand entered Burgos, where he was acclaimed.\nThere were still several fortresses left to be recovered, including Belorado, N\u00e1jera, Navarrete, and San Clemente.\nThe first two remained loyal to \u00c1lvaro's brother Gonzalo, while the last two surrendered to the king.\nIn September 1217, King Ferdinand left Burgos and headed toward Palencia.\n\u00c1lvaro's brother Fernando lay in ambush at Revilla Vallejera, but the ambush failed on being found out by the king's forces.\n\u00c1lvaro attempted another ambush on the outskirts of Herreruela de Castiller\u00eda.\nOn the 20th, the brothers Alfonso and Suero T\u00e9llez de Meneses along with \u00c1lvaro Rodr\u00edguez Gir\u00f3n, Gonzalo's brother, caught the Lara brothers by surprise.\nWhile his brothers escaped, \u00c1lvaro was taken prisoner to Valladolid where he was obliged, as a minimal condition of release, to relinquish the fortresses he controlled, including Alarc\u00f3n, Ca\u00f1ete, Tariego, Amaya, Villafranca Montes de Oca, Cerezo de R\u00edo Tir\u00f3n, Pancorbo, Belorado, and other places.\nOnce \u00c1lvaro was back in Le\u00f3n, where he still held the post of royal high steward, the kings of Le\u00f3n and Castile agreed a truce in November 1217 in which \u00c1lvaro and his brother Fernando N\u00fa\u00f1ez de Lara both took part.\nHowever, the peace did not hold and, possibly encouraged by \u00c1lvaro, Alfonso IX invaded Castile in the spring of 1218 and took the fortress of Valdenebro near Medina de Rioseco.\n\u00c1lvaro tried to recover the castles he was forced to cede when he was captured and imprisoned, and offered to exchange them for Valdenebro, an offer which Ferdinand III refused.\nFerdinand III went to Tordehumos whence he resisted the invasions of the Laras who, in turn, convinced Alfonso IX to break the truce and attack Castile.\nAlfonso's troops set out from Salamanca.\nHis son Ferdinand decided to stage his first invasion of Le\u00f3n, sending Lope D\u00edaz de Haro, \u00c1lvaro D\u00edaz de Cameros, and Garc\u00eda Fern\u00e1ndez de Villamayor.\nHowever, soon they were forced to retreat and seek refuge in Castrej\u00f3n de la Pe\u00f1a, which was then surrounded by Alfonso and the Laras.\n\u00c1lvaro, taking part in the siege, became gravely ill and left for Toro, where he decided to join the Order of Santiago.\nAccording to the chronicle of Archbishop Jim\u00e9nez de Rada, \u00c1lvaro N\u00fa\u00f1ez de Lara took ill and died in Castrej\u00f3n, where he had come in pursuit of Gonzalo Rodr\u00edguez Gir\u00f3n and Lope D\u00edaz de Haro.\nThe \"Cr\u00f3nica general vulgata\" differs from this account, stating that he was taken to Toro, joined the Order, and died there.\n\u00c1lvaro married Urraca D\u00edaz de Haro, daughter of Diego L\u00f3pez II de Haro, Lord of Biscay, and his wife Toda P\u00e9rez de Azagra.\nThey had no children.\nIn 1217, he gave his wife's aunt Urraca L\u00f3pez de Haro several properties in la Bureba which allowed the queen dowager of Le\u00f3n to found the Abbey of Santa Mar\u00eda la Real de Vile\u00f1a.\nHe had four illegitimate children with Teresa Gil de Osorno:"}

Buenaventura de Boadalquivi was a Spanish mission located on St. Simon's Island, Georgia, United States from between 1597 and 1609 until 1684, when pirates burned the mission and its town.\nThe mission moved to the north side of the St. Johns River near its mouth, in present day Duval County, Florida under the name of Santa Cruz de Guadalquini or Santa Cruz y San Buenaventura de Guadalquini for a few years before merging with the mission San Juan del Puerto.\n\"Guadalquini\" was the Timucua language name for St. Simon's Island, which the Spanish called \"Isla de Ballenas\" (Isle of Whales).\nThe name also appeared in several Spanish documents as .\nFor most of the 20th century historians thought the mission of San Buenaventura de Guadalquini had been located on Jekyll Island, but examination of previously known and newly discovered documentary evidence has identified Gualdalquini with St. Simons.\nMany scholars in the early 20th century identified the people of San Buenaventura de Guadalquini as Guale.\nHann cites evidence that the people of Guadalquini at least as early as 1580 were part of the Mocama people.\nAshley, et al.\nsuggest that Gualdalquini may have been occupied by the Guale people when Europeans arrived in southeastern Georgia in the 16th century, and that the original Guale population on Guadalquini was displaced from at least the southern part of the island after the Guale rebellion of 1597, and replaced by Timucua speaking Mocama people.\nTwo French ships visited Guadalquini in 1580, in an attempt to recruit coastal tribes to attack the Spanish presidio at Santa Elena (on what is now Parris Island, South Carolina).\nAbout 1,000 warriors from towns along the Georgia and South Carolina coast besieged Santa Elena for a couple of weeks, but left without success.\nThe mission of San Buenaventura was established on the southern end of Guadalquini sometime between 1597 and 1609 (probably near the present-day St. Simons Island Light), and was the northernmost mission in the Mocama area.\nThe mission was 32 leagues from St. Augustine.\nSan Buenaventura de Gualdalquini mission was the site of a Franciscan provincial chapter meeting in 1618, because food was cheaper there than in St. Augustine, and friars could travel there by canoe from the missions in the Guale and Timucua provinces, including the missions in the St. Johns River valley.\nThe governor of Florida, Alonso de Aranguiz y Cotes, stationed Spanish soldiers at San Buenaventura after Chichimecos (the Spanish name for Westos) destroyed the Santo Domingo de Talaje mission (on the Altamaha River) in 1661.\nRaiders from the Chichimeco, Uchise (the Spanish name for Muscogee), and Chiluque (a name the Spanish used for a faction of the Mocamo and for Yamassee) and possibly other nations, aided and supported by the English in the Province of Carolina, attacked Gualdalquini's neighbor Colon in 1680.\nA force of Spanish soldiers and Native Americans from San Buenaventura went to the aid of Colon.\nThe raiders withdrew, and then attacked the mission of Santa Catalina de Guale on St. Catherines Island to the north.\nIn 1684, raiding parties sponsored by the Province of Carolina attacked missions in the Guale and Mocama provinces.\nInformation on the population of the mission is scanty.\nA (possibly incomplete) census in 1675 reported 40 Christians at the mission.\nIn 1681 a census reported 45 men and 42 women over the age of 12.\nThe mission of Santa Isabel de Utinahica may have been merged into San Buenaventura around the middle of the 17th century.\nClara, \"cacica\" (female chief) of Utinihica was still resident in the relocated mission of Santa Cruz y San Buenaventura de Guadalquini in 1685.\nIn 1683, St. Augustine was attacked by a pirate fleet.\nTogether with the attacks on the missions along what is now the Georgia coast from Native American allies of the English, the pirate raid led Governor Juan M\u00e1rquez Cabrera to order those missions to move closer to St. Augustine.\nAs part of the plan, the mission of San Buenaventura was to be merged with the mission San Juan del Puerto.\nBefore the mission could be moved, pirates returned to the area in the second half of 1684.\nOn hearing of the presence of the pirates, Lorenzo de Santiago, chief of San Buenaventura, moved the people of his village, along with most of their property and stored maize, to the mainland.\nWhen the pirates landed at San Buenaventura, they found only ten men under a sub-chief who had been left to guard the village.\nThe San Buenaventura men withdrew to the woods, and the pirates burned the village and mission.\nAfter the pirates burned the mission, the people of Guadalquini moved to a site on the north side of the St. Johns River about one league west of San Juan del Puerto, where a new mission named Santa Cruz de Guadalquini was established.\nThe mission was probably placed on a site known as Vera Cruz to Spanish, the site of a \"visita\" (outlying mission site of the San Juan mission) that had been abandoned fifty years earlier, which may account for the adoption of the name Santa Cruz.\nIn 1685 residents of Santa Cruz asked that Guales, people from Colon, and other Yamassees be allowed to join the village.\nThere were 60 families in Santa Cruz in 1689, twice as many as at San Juan.\nIn 1695, residents of Santa Cruz included chiefs from San Simon and Colon, who were not Mocama.\nThe mission of Santa Cruz was merged into the mission of San Juan del Puerto by 1697.\nLorenzo de Santiago, who had been chief of the town of San Buenaventura on Guadalquini before it moved in 1684, had become the chief of San Juan by 1701.\nIt appears that most of the residents of San Juan in 1701 had come from the Guadalquini mission.\nSome of the residents there had come from the village of Colon that had been to the north of the San Buenaventura mission on Guadalquini.\nLorenzo de Santiago, long chief of Guadalquini, became the principal chief in Mocama Province.\nThe people at San Juan in 1701 wanted to move to a location south of the St. Johns River called Piritirica, but the Governor in St. Augustine required a town be kept at San Juan for early detection of attacks by the English or their native allies.\nSome of the inhabitants of Santa Cruz were allowed to moved to Piritihica, which was three leagues from Santa Cruz across the St.Johns River, and residents who remained at Santa Cruz were allowed to cultivate fields at Piritihica.\nThe mission at San Juan del Puerto, the new settlement at Piritihica, and the other remaining Spanish missions along the coast north of the St. Johns River, were destroyed in 1702 by soldiers from the Province of Carolina and their native allies.\nThe residents of the missions fled to St. Augustine shortly before the attacks.\nShortly after the English and their native allies abandoned their siege of St. Augustine and withdrew north, the Spanish and Guale and Mocama natives returned to Piritihica.\nThe Spanish built a stockade, and settled the natives in villages to the north and south of the stockade.\nOne village was for the Guale, who had fled the missions on Amelia Island.\nThe other village held the Mocama refugees from San Juan del Puerto, who included the people who had once lived at San Buenaventura de Guadalquini.\nOne-and-a-half years later, natives allied with the English attacked Piritihica, killing or carrying off many of the inhabitants.\nThe survivors from the Mocama village, some of whom had once lived on Guadalquini Island, were resettled in Palica, a village five leagues from St. Augustine, the fourth time they had moved in twenty years.\nArchaeologists have excavated a site on Black Hammock Island in the Timucuan Ecological and Historic Preserve that may be the site.\nThe Cedar Point archaeological site (8Du81) is at the south end of Black Hammock Island, and has been occupied off and on for over 4,000 years, from the Archaic period until the 20th century."}

With the help of Nick and while still pursuing his degree at Emerson, Syd secured the representation of Wally's World of Entertainment, an agency specializing in college events.\nOver the next few years, Syd would play festivals supporting bands like, Cake, John Mayer, Jason Mraz and fellow Emersonian Eric Hutchinson.\nThrough the National Association of Campus Activities events, Syd played over 250 colleges, mostly in the northeast and the Midwest.\nIn 2004 Syd released a well-polished second album, titled \"Fault Lines\".\nThe new album was produced by Todd Hannigan and Jesse Siebenberg.\nLongtime childhood friend Jeremiah \"Tuck\" Stocking contributed guitar and songwriting.\nThe album was mixed and mastered by Jason Mariani at Brotheryn Studios.\nThe album was a notable success, especially online where it garnered 20,000 album downloads.\nAfter graduating from Emerson College with a degree in New Media, Syd spent time alternately in New York, Boston and Vermont.\nHe continued to tour in support of his albums and play the college and festival circuits while writing material which would soon take him back to his Vermont roots.\nRecorded in Williamstown, VT Syd released, \"The Way We Found It\" in 2007, and one review suggested Syd was, \"\"taking cues from Elliot [sic] Smith instead of Jack Johnson this time around\"\".\nThe album featured Dylan Allen on guitar, bass and vocals, Sam Smith on drums (now playing with Ben Folds).\nIt was engineered by Justin Galenski, mixed by Jeff Thall and was executive produced by Danny Weinkauff, bassist for They Might Be Giants.\nIn early 2008, Syd was still touring, sometimes as a solo artist and sometimes with the Who's That Pack, a singer / songwriter \"super group\" consisting of Chad Perrone, Tim Blane, Patrick Thomas Cupples and Syd.\nHowever, Syd's pattern of songwriting and recording changed that year when he was approached by Lisa Piccirillo to produce her debut album, \"Momentum\".\nThis unplanned journey to the other side of the glass fed his growing interest in performance, composition and creating a finished product through collaboration with other artists.\nUsing the talent and songs of Piccirillo, Syd brought Patrick Thomas Cupples in to work on the songs and production, and commissioned artwork from Aaron Taylor Waldman (ATW), photography from Sea Wall Productions and mixing and mastering from Lane Gibson Productions.\nJust as \"Week Days, Weak Knees\" launched Syd as a musician, \"Momentum\" marked a new beginning as well.\nNot only was it the first official appearance of Syd as a record producer, it was also the beginning of The Co-Op, a music collective aimed at bringing creative minds together and putting their various talents to use.\nWith the launch of Momentum underway, Syd moved his focus to Gregory Douglass' album \"Battler\".\nReleased in 2009 and co-produced with Douglass, \"Battler\" saw more familiar faces join the process including Dylan Allen on guitar and bass and Matt Bogdanow on drums.\nThe album also featured a duet with fellow Vermonter Grace Potter.\n\"Battler\" was mixed with Lane Gibson in Charlotte, VT, and the album was mastered by Jonathan Wyner at M-Works in Boston.\nThe album came out to critical acclaim, and Syd even got a few honorable mentions for producing the album: \"\"Battler might represent Douglass\u2019 cleanest effort to date, which is saying something given the immaculate nature of his previous works.\nLongtime friend and producer Syd deserves the credit here\"\".\nAfter putting his own music on hold, it was time to lay down some new music of his own.\nIn late 2009, Syd released the EP \"Upswing\".\nIt was created west of Los Angeles, in Oxnard, California at Drum Channel Studios.\nDylan Allen once again played guitar and bass and Matt Bogdanow played drums on 2 songs (\"The Pattern\" and \"Mallory\") and Syd returned to the drums and laid down his first recorded percussion performances on \"The Big Town\" and \"Easier on You\".\nThe tracks were laid down with Kevin Majorino at Drum Channel, but as he had done in the past, Syd returned to Vermont to mix and master with Lane Gibson.\nThe EP was described as, \"\"unbridled, hook-heavy pop\"\".\nSyd and his band went back on tour in support of the new record, but as it would turn out, Friday March 6, 2009\u2014the last tour date for \"Upswing\" in Winooski, Vermont--would be the last Syd show for many years.\nThough never publicly stating it, the project seems to be on hiatus.\nSyd's input and skills were in high demand and the next few years saw him contributing to more and more record production projects.\nIn 2010, Syd was a part of the release of Zac Clark's debut album, \"Young Volcanoes\".\nThe connections made throughout his career also lead to an enduring project with Patrick Thomas Cupples and Lisa Piccirillo.\nThey embarked on a musical experiment they came to call Hotels & Highways.\n2010 saw the release of their first album, \"Lost River\", which was created over the course of 10 days while the trio lived in a cabin in Putnam Valley, NY.\nThey composed, recorded and produced the album as a songwriting intensive and, once recorded, the project was funded entirely through a successful Kickstarter campaign.\nThe roots/folk/rock album was released to great acclaim and became an Amazon Editors Pick for 2011.\nIt also earned them a spot at the South by Southwest ASCAP showcase in Austin, TX alongside Dan Wilson (Semisonic) and The Civil Wars.\nIn early 2011, Hotels & Highways teamed up with Mia Dyson for an east coast tour, which in turn led to several more.\nDyson, an Australian singer and songwriter, has been lauded in her home country, winning an ARIA award among other accolades, and she has been steadily gaining a popular following in the US.\nIn the winter of 2011/2012, Syd and Patrick Thomas Cupples co-produced Dyson's new album \"The Moment\".\nAlongside Dyson's singing and guitar work, the album features Syd on drums and Lee Pardini on bass and keys.\nReleased with the help of The Co-Op, the album has garnered exceptional press in Australia, including 4 stars in Rolling Stone Magazine and critics are claiming, \"\"Dyson...deserves every piece of praise that comes her way for what some have described [as] her career defining album\"\".\nJune 2012 saw Hotels & Highways and Dyson team up once more for an east coast tour, which led straight into another recording.\nOnce again Hotels & Highways adhered to their \"cabin-grown music\" philosophy and transformed a basement in western Massachusetts into a recording studio.\nThe trio released \"Greetings from Wilbraham\" on July 1 as a gift to their fans.\nSyd has also been playing drums, writing and producing music in Ventura, California's hometown \"western thrash\" band, The Pullmen.\nThere is a family connection in the band...the lead singer, Shane Cohn, is also Syd's brother in law.\nThe band also features Matt Kash, formerly of The Missing 23rd.\nUpcoming projects include new music from Zac Clark, BWilling James, The Pullmen and Mia Dyson."}
